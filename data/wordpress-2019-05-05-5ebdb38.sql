This feature adds two new pages in the admin interface to help end users maintain a healthy site through common configuration issues and other elements that go along with having a robust online presence. It also provides a standardized location for developers to add debugging information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fatal Error Recovery Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">The Fatal Error Recovery Mode feature</a> was originally planned for the 5.1 release but was delayed to patch up some last-minute issues that arose. This feature will help site-owners recover more quickly from fatal errors that break the display or functionality of their site that would ordinarily require code or database edits to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Privacy and Accessibility Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the headlining features mentioned above, there are some important enhancements to the privacy and accessibility features included in Core. These include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/\">some important developer-focused changes</a> to how privacy policy pages are displayed and user data is exported, as well as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/\">moving to more semantic markup for admin tabs</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">other improvements</a> such as switching post format icons to drop-down menus on post list tables, improved admin toolbar markup, and contextual improvements to archive widget drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\">Dashicons</a> library was last updated was over 3 years ago. Now, in the upcoming release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\">a set of 13 new icons will be added to the library</a> along with improvements to the build process and file format of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Editor Upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Editor has seen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-april/\">numerous improvements</a> lately that will all be included in the v5.2 release. Along with the interface upgrades, the underlying Javascript module <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/\">has been reorganized</a>, improvements have been made to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/block-editor-detection-improvements-in-5-2/\">how the block editor is detected</a> on the post edit screen, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/25/building-javascript/\">the Javascript build process has been enhanced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in the Release Candidate phase</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

If you attempt to update WordPress manually, that update will fail. To continue using the latest features of WordPress you must update to a newer version of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When updating to a new version of PHP, WordPress encourages updating to its recommended version, PHP 7.3. The PHP internals team has done a great job making its most recent version the fastest version of PHP yet. This means that updating will improve the speed of your site, both for you and your visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This performance increase also means fewer servers are needed to host websites. Updating PHP isn&#8217;t just good for your site, it also means less energy is needed for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/one-third-of-the-web/\">1-in-3 sites that use WordPress</a>, so it&#8217;s good for the planet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help updating to a new version of PHP, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/\">detailed documentation is available</a>.  This includes sample communication to send to your host for them to assist you. Many hosting companies have published information on how to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy-resources/blob/master/tutorials/hosting-specific/tutorials-en.md\">update PHP</a> that is specific for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.6 now, but soon 7+</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first increase in PHP required version for WordPress since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/\">2010</a>, but may not be the only increase in 2019. The WordPress core team will monitor the adoption of the most recent versions of PHP with an eye towards making PHP 7+ the minimum version towards the end of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/#how-to-update-your-websites-php-version-for-a-faster-more-secure-website\">Update PHP today, so you can update WordPress tomorrow!</a></p></blockquote></figure>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6810\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n\n		\n				\n								\n										\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"The Month in WordPress: March 2019\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/the-month-in-wordpress-march-2019/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 Apr 2019 08:59:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6846\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:368:\"WordPress reached a significant milestone this month.

This release will include some great new features, along with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/\">the latest updates to the block editor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most anticipated new features is the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/the-improved-fatal-error-protection/\">improved fatal error detection</a> &#8211; this was removed from v5.1 shortly before release so that it could be improved and made more secure for this release.

In an effort to make it easier for content creators to find these block types, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/\">there is a proposal</a> for a new type of plugin and a directory to handle it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal outlines a new type of WordPress plugin that provides blocks and nothing else, named Single Block Plugins. The primary benefit would be to provide content creators with individual pieces of functionality and new types of blocks without the need to search for and install new plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Single Block Plugins would be hosted in a separate Block Directory section of the Plugin Directory and they would initially be JavaScript-based. Each plugin will register a single block, and they will be searchable and installable from within the editor itself. This puts blocks at the publishers’ fingertips &#8212; you no longer have to leave the editor to find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in shaping this new type of plugin?

Here are some of the big items to test so we can find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor has received significant performance improvements since WordPress 5.1, shaving 35% off the load time for massive posts, and cutting the keypress time (how responsive it feels when you&#8217;re typing) in half!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility continues to improve, too. The block editor now supports your browser&#8217;s reduced motion settings. The post URL slug has better labelling and help text. The focus styling for keyboard navigating through landmarks is clearer and more consistent. There are a variety of new speak messages, and existing messages have been tweaked for more useful screen-reader behaviour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve added several new blocks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An RSS block</li><li>An Amazon Kindle embed block</li><li>A Search block</li><li>A Calendar block</li><li>A Tag Cloud block</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you keep track of these blocks, and only show the ones you need, there&#8217;s a new block management tool to switch blocks on and off.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?fit=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6806\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/01-block-manager-1024x768.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" /><figcaption>Block Management Modal</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re constantly working on existing blocks, too. There are hundreds of bug fixes and improvements in the block editor, you can read more about them in the Gutenberg plugin releases: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/23/whats-new-in-gutenberg-23th-january/\">4.9</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/06/whats-new-in-gutenberg-6th-february/\">5.0</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-february/\">5.1</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/06/whats-new-in-gutenberg-6th-march/\">5.2</a>, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/\">5.3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The WordPress Mobile Apps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor isn&#8217;t just for websites, either. The WordPress mobile apps now include an experimental version of a built-in block editor. This is still under development, but you can try it out now!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-make-wordpress-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"BEX89Pj6RV\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2019/02/26/the-block-editor-is-coming-to-the-mobile-apps/\">The block editor is coming to the mobile apps</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;The block editor is coming to the mobile apps&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Mobile\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/mobile/2019/02/26/the-block-editor-is-coming-to-the-mobile-apps/embed/#?secret=BEX89Pj6RV\" data-secret=\"BEX89Pj6RV\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Site Health Check</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Health Check is an ongoing project aimed at improving the stability and performance of the entire WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first phase of this project (originally scoped for WordPress 5.1) is now included in WordPress 5.2. For the first time, WordPress will catch and pause the problem code, so you can log in to your Dashboard and see what the problem is (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44458\">#44458</a>).

The project was based on <a href=\"https://github.com/front/gutenberg-js\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg.js</a>, a package that makes it easier to bring Gutenberg into other applications.   </p>\n<p><a href=\"ttps://reazzon.ru\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Khaetsky</a>, a backend developer at Biz-Mark, took Laraberg and used it to build a Gutenberg plugin for the open source OctoberCMS, which is based on Laravel. OctobeCMS was launched in 2015, and still captures only a tiny sliver of the CMS market share, but it is growing in popularity among the top one million websites, according to stats from <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/October-CMS\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BuiltWith</a>. The CMS has a growing ecosystem of more than 700 themes and plugins.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://octobercms.com/plugin/reazzon-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg for OctoberCMS</a> plugin is now in beta. It allows developers to embed Gutenberg in the backend via their own model by <a href=\"https://octobercms.com/docs/database/relations#polymorphic-relations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">creating a Polymorphic relation</a>. The plugin integrates Laraberg but all of its blocks are standard from the Gutenberg.js package. It doesn&#8217;t include anything custom. </p>\n<p>Most aspects of Gutenberg are working in the beta, including common blocks, formatting, layout, and embed blocks, custom styles, and block settings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/gutenberg-october-cms.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>None of WordPress&#8217; standard widgets work in the plugin and Khaetsky said he plans to remove them in future updates.</p>\n<p>Anything that requires media uploading, such as the gallery block, inline images, and cover block, are not working. Khaetsky said he is working on getting the plugin integrated with the native OctoberCMS Medialibrary. He encouraged anyone who wants to contribute to that effort to submit a PR to the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/FlusherDock1/Gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a>. </p>\n<p>Khaetsky&#8217;s free plugin is MIT-licensed and available in the official OctoberCMS plugin marketplace. The plugin&#8217;s adoption is limited to developers who know how to implement it, but it already has 39 installations. <a href=\"https://octobercms.com/plugin/reazzon-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Documentation</a> is available on the plugin listing.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 May 2019 23:01:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: Block Options Plugin Rebrands to EditorsKit, Expands Beyond Block Visibility Management\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89273\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/block-options-plugin-rebrands-to-editorskit-expands-beyond-block-visibility-management\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2816:\"<p>WordPress plugin developer <a href=\"https://jeffreycarandang.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffrey Carandang</a> has rebranded his <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-options/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Block Options</a> plugin to <a href=\"https://editorskit.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EditorsKit</a>. Carandang created Block Options prior to co-founding CoBlocks, which was recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-themebeans-coblocks-block-gallery-and-block-unit-tests\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">acquired by GoDaddy</a>. It began as a plugin for controlling block visibility, inspired by his <a href=\"https://widget-options.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Widget Options</a> plugin, but has since grown to include more features for managing Gutenberg blocks. EditorsKit now offers the following capabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Devices Visibility Options</li>\n<li>User Login State Visibility</li>\n<li>Display Logic</li>\n<li>Advanced Custom Fields Integration</li>\n<li>Block Guide Lines</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;As much as I love the name &#8216;Block Options,&#8217; it has started to become too generic and has been used a lot on the Gutenberg editor itself,&#8221; Carandang said. &#8220;So, I have decided to change the name to something that stands out and fits the purpose more – page building block options for the new editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The name EditorsKit came from &#8216;Editor’s Toolkit.&#8217; I’ve been progressively moving towards building a set of tools that will help users navigate through the editor more conveniently, besides giving them visibility control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Version 1.4 of the plugin introduces the new Block Guide Lines feature, one of the features to go beyond visibility management. It allows users to toggle guide lines on/off for titles and editor blocks to check element boundaries. Carandang said the feature becomes especially useful when handling nested blocks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The last major release of the plugin also improves the UI and UX with a new “Visibility Settings” modal for managing all visibilities in the same place.

Pablo and Luis discovered a lot of people were concerned about the way their WordPress sites performed on mobile devices. They thought it would be a  powerful solution to build an open source platform that could be extended by other WordPress developers.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I met Pablo and Luis in late 2015, loved their project and joined them. I was used to working with WordPress as a content editor, but I didn’t have a technical background. So I mostly started helping by writing blog posts, social media content, documentation, and providing user support. Now I’m in charge of Frontity’s marketing and communications. (I still don’t code but would love to learn at some point!)<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that first prototype, they decided to develop a free platform not just for creating mobile apps. The idea was that any WordPress user could build mobile apps, progressive web apps, or add Google AMP to their blogs in a very easy way. This was Worona 1.0, which was launched in February of 2017. Thousands of WordPress users joined that journey, and we’re truly thankful for that. At that time we already used React and fetched the blog’s content using WordPress&#8217;s REST API. The mobile apps were created with <a href=\"https://cordova.apache.org/\">Cordova</a>.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Worona had a loyal following, we were aware that mobile app usage was slowly declining. People don’t want to download an app for every blog they read. Plus, Apple stopped supporting apps from app generation platforms like ours. This became a serious problem as we couldn’t grow under that scenario.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s when we decided to bet on the mobile web and started working on a new framework for building Progressive Web App themes (based on React) on top of WordPress. In 2018 we rebranded to Frontity and got financial backing to make the project grow. Although our main goal was to keep the code open source, we decided to use it internally and release a product exclusively to WordPress publishers (we called it Frontity PRO), so we could see what happened and gather feedback.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frontity PRO is a proprietary mobile theme built on React for WordPress blogs and news sites. It implements Progressive Web App technologies and uses the REST API to fetch the content, along with our WordPress plugin, WordPress<em> </em>PWA.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time Frontity PRO was created, we also contributed to the official WCEU PWA. Building a PWA from the ground up is a difficult and time-consuming task, but we had created a framework to precisely solve that problem. It was the perfect time to test it out and give back to the community.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have worked with Spanish media companies since we launched Frontity PRO, and the result has been great. Our theme has allowed them to deliver faster and more engaging mobile experiences, which has been proven to increase their pageviews and ad revenue. Our internal framework has served content to more than 20 million readers. Some of our major clients were part of ADSLZone group, like <em>Medios y Redes</em>, <em>Tendenzias</em> or Coches.com. They all use WordPress.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this time, we realized that many of our clients&#8217; tech teams were considering using our framework to develop their own custom themes. This was one of the main reasons that made us think about open sourcing it — it seemed the perfect moment. Plus, this was our original vision.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months ago, we finally decided to go straight for that vision. We set aside the development work of Frontity PRO to place all our focus on Frontity.org, the open source framework. Our next milestone is to release the first beta version in the next few weeks. (Early May 2019.) More than 300 developers have already signed up to try it out. We are really excited about this project and believe it can make a real impact in the WordPress ecosystem.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since our resources are limited, we are looking for some financial backing again to bring contributors on board and build a thriving community of people interested in WordPress and React.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PS: What problems does Frontity solve? (And whose problems are they?) Will Frontity make frontend development more accessible to people who are new to React?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> In order to create a WordPress theme with React, developers need to learn and configure lots of different things: bundling, transpiling, routing, server rendering, retrieving data from WordPress, managing state, managing CSS, linting, testing,&#8230;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are already some amazing React frameworks, such as Next.js and GatsbyJS, that can work with WordPress, but they&#8217;re not focused exclusively on it. As a result, there&#8217;s still some complex configuration and additional tooling left to the developer. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what Frontity aims to solve; we want to make everything much simpler for WordPress developers and more accessible to those who are new to React. Each part of the framework has been simplified and optimized to be used with WordPress, and developers don&#8217;t need to figure out what tools to use for things like CSS or state management.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is ready so they can get WordPress and React to work together in an easier way. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does Frontity differ from Genesis, _s, or WP Rig — from the developer and designer&#8217;s perspective, and in the end user&#8217;s experience?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> Genesis, _s or WP Rig are fantastic frameworks to develop WordPress themes based on PHP. These themes use the PHP WordPress rendering engine, which means they rely on a server-side architecture where almost every interaction that is made by the user on his device needs to wait for the server to render the new result. Our framework is focused on developers who want to create a React frontend and connect it to a WordPress backend using the REST API. We can call this a client-side architecture, where all the logic and rendering happen directly on the device and the calls to the server are limited only to data sourcing.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few years, web development has evolved a lot. One of the main reasons is the shift to mobile devices and the need for fast web experiences. Achieving this is not easy using a server-side architecture. This is why client-side libraries like React are becoming so popular.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the developer perspective, everything changes! A theme developed with Frontity and React has zero PHP in it, only JavaScript and CSS. This might sound like a radical change, but there is a trend of developers using WordPress as a headless CMS with a decoupled JavaScript frontend for whom our framework can be quite useful.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does Frontity the framework fit into a business model or revenue stream for Frontity the company?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> We won&#8217;t develop any business model in this initial phase. The framework will always be 100% free and open source. Right now, we are focused on building a community of developers and contributors around the framework.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Possible monetizations in the future are a hosting solution, premium support, or a marketplace of paid themes.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What opportunities do you see for WordPress developers now and in the near future? </strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> With the shift to Gutenberg as well as the rise of headless CMS approaches, the WordPress community has started considering React for their projects. Beside this, modern libraries like React are becoming essential to rich user experiences.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The client-side approach to theme-building opens a world of new possibilities: storing and pre-fetching content, animations within themes, offline experiences, and more. It also has enormous benefits in terms of performance, UX and design.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>React presents an opportunity to accelerate things in the WordPress ecosystem, build modern and engaging frontend experiences, and extend what developers can do with this powerful CMS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Pictured in the Frontity team photo above, from left to right, back row first: Eduardo Campaña (developer), David Arenas (developer), Carmen Fernández (no longer with the company), Mario Santos, (Community), Reyes Martínez (Marketing &amp; Communications), Pablo Postigo (Founder &amp; CEO), and Luis Herranz (Founder &amp; Lead developer).</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 May 2019 17:48:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US 2019 Tickets Now on Sale\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89259\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2019-tickets-now-on-sale\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3340:\"<p><a href=\"https://2019.us.wordcamp.org/tickets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tickets</a> for WordCamp US 2019 went on sale this week.

We hope this report generates discussion about accessibility, excitement about inclusive design, and action toward improving the editing experience.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Beyond its use for WordPress core, the audit is also a valuable resource for those extending Gutenberg and more broadly for developers who are building React-based projects.</p>\n<p>Tenon&#8217;s report includes a 34-page <a href=\"https://documents.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Executive_Summary.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Executive Summary</a>, highlighting key findings from the usability testing and technical review. It&#8217;s important to note that the audit was conducted on WordPress version 5.0.3 in January 2019. Since that time the Gutenberg and Accessibility teams have resolved an additional <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3AAccessibility+closed%3A%3E2019-01-03\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">116 accessibility issues</a>, which will be included in WordPress 5.2 next week.</p>\n<p>As expected, Tenon&#8217;s results show that overall the markup generated by Gutenberg is &#8220;clean, semantically correct and accessible&#8221; but that &#8220;Gutenberg’s user experience is consistently poor.&#8221; The audit found that Gutenberg fails to comply with all 30 of the WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria. </p>\n<p>Tenon&#8217;s findings confirm the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-delivers-sobering-assessment-of-gutenberg-we-have-to-draw-a-line\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> WordPress&#8217; Accessibility Team published in October 2018 regarding the editor&#8217;s overall level of accessibility:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;The accessibility team will continue to work to support Gutenberg to the best of our ability. However, based on its current status, we cannot recommend that anybody who has a need for assistive technology allow it to be in use on any sites they need to use at this time.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>At that time, many WordPress contributors urged leadership not to ship an editor with critical accessibility issues that prevented people using assistive technologies from moving forward with the latest version.</p>\n<p>Tenon&#8217;s Executive Summary concludes that the new editor is a step backwards for people with disabilities:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Gutenberg has significant and pervasive accessibility problems, the likes of which amount to a step backwards for users with disabilities over the legacy editor. Our user-based testing – backed by data from our technical review – indicates that the accessibility problems are severe in nature. We feel concerned that Gutenberg’s current accessibility issues will prove problematic for website owners who deploy Gutenberg to content creators in protected populations or for website owners who are themselves part of a protected population. Therefore, organizations which have high risk profiles should consult legal counsel before using it and may want to choose to use the legacy editor instead.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tenon recommended that Gutenberg&#8217;s developers aggressively tackle the issues uncovered in the <a href=\"https://documents.wpcampus.org/gutenberg/audit/Gutenberg_Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">technical report</a>, given the size of WordPress&#8217; user base.

This feature adds two new pages in the admin interface to help end users maintain a healthy site through common configuration issues and other elements that go along with having a robust online presence. It also provides a standardized location for developers to add debugging information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fatal Error Recovery Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/\">The Fatal Error Recovery Mode feature</a> was originally planned for the 5.1 release but was delayed to patch up some last-minute issues that arose. This feature will help site-owners recover more quickly from fatal errors that break the display or functionality of their site that would ordinarily require code or database edits to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Privacy and Accessibility Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the headlining features mentioned above, there are some important enhancements to the privacy and accessibility features included in Core. These include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/\">some important developer-focused changes</a> to how privacy policy pages are displayed and user data is exported, as well as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/\">moving to more semantic markup for admin tabs</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/\">other improvements</a> such as switching post format icons to drop-down menus on post list tables, improved admin toolbar markup, and contextual improvements to archive widget drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\">Dashicons</a> library was last updated was over 3 years ago. Now, in the upcoming release, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\">a set of 13 new icons will be added to the library</a> along with improvements to the build process and file format of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Editor Upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Editor has seen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-april/\">numerous improvements</a> lately that will all be included in the v5.2 release. Along with the interface upgrades, the underlying Javascript module <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/\">has been reorganized</a>, improvements have been made to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/block-editor-detection-improvements-in-5-2/\">how the block editor is detected</a> on the post edit screen, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/25/building-javascript/\">the Javascript build process has been enhanced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\">WordPress 5.2 is now in the Release Candidate phase</a> and you can test it by installing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

Went through some hard times when I was in university. It was also difficult for me to pay the university dues due to financial shortcomings.</p>\n<p>I am a sportsman and still have a wish to play in International Cricket which seems impossible from where I am today. At one point, I wished to join Pakistan Air Force but life directed me towards Computer Sciences.</p>\n<p>I started using a computer in ​2010​ when I joined <a href=\"https://gcuf.edu.pk/\">​Government College University Faisalabad​</a>. Came to know about WordPress while I was finishing the last semester of my degree and my FYP was based on WordPress.</p>\n<p>My mother&#8211;who is no more in this world&#8211;was the real hero of my life and stayed by my side till her last breath. I remember my kindergarten days when she helped me with my homework. I remember the moments in which she used to stay standing in front of the house while I drove off to school.</p>\n<p>I remember her last day at the hospital. I met her in the ICU before her heart surgery. She hugged me and said ​“<strong>Don’t worry, everything will be good</strong>”​. She expired during the surgery. I pray for her soul to rest in peace every day.</p>\n<h3>Start of Career:</h3>\n<p>Something had always felt missing in my life, but I felt like I was on the right track for the first time in my life when I joined the WordPress community. After graduation, I struggled a lot to get my first job. I joined <a href=\"https://www.presstigers.com/\">​PressTigers​</a> as a Software Engineer and continued struggling to make my position better.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FahadShakeel\">Khawaja Fahad Shakeel​</a> was my first mentor. For me, it has always been an honour to work with him. He directed me towards the right path and provided me with endless support.</p>\n<h3>Community &#8211; WordCamps and Meetups:</h3>\n<p>I am using WordPress since ​2015​. Once I started attending meetups and open source contribution, it turned out to be a game changer for me.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>I learned a lot of things from the WordPress Community platform. There are a lot of personalities who have left a deep impression on met. One of them is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jainnidhi03\">​Nidhi Jain​</a> from Udaipur India. At this point, she is like a sister to me. We have an amazing chemistry when it comes to working on WordPress dev. The second one is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/desrosj\">​Jonathan Desrosiers​</a> who is like my big brother whom I have learned a lot from and continue to do more every day.</p>\n<p>WordPress Community is where I feel the most comfortable, after my family. I am supporting local WordPress communities and was part of ​WordCamp Karachi​ as an organizer. It was the first time that I spoke in an international level event.</p>\n<p>People around the globe know me because of WordPress. This is why WordPress is my identity. I owe a huge part of who I am to the WordPress Community.</p>\n<h3>WordPress and Future:</h3>\n<p>I believe WordPress can never die as long as people don’t stop baking new things and curating it according to the demands of the new era.</p>\n<p><em>The beauty of WordPress is that it is made for everyone.</em></p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Lahore/members/?op=leaders&sort=name\">​co-organizer of WordPress Meetup Lahore​</a> it is an honor for me to provide a platform for people to gather under one roof, to learn and share something with the community. I believe in diversity and would love to involve more people in the community leadership team.</p>\n<p>I am extremely hopeful regarding the WordPress Meetup Lahore group and welcome everyone to contribute into making it great.</p>\n<p>I have been terribly impressed by <a href=\"https://walktowc.eu/\">​Marcel​</a> as he walked for WC Europe and I would love to walk for WC Asia after the approval.</p>\n<p>In the future, if I get a chance in politics, I wish to be a part of upper house as a <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov.pk/\">​SENATOR OF PAKISTAN​</a>. Hopefully, I will be contesting in the next senate election either from the platform of the ruling party or as an independent candidate.</p>\n<h3>Community Mentor:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Usman__Khalid\">Usman Khalid​</a>, the lead organizer of WC Karachi, is the hero behind the scenes for establishing the communities in Pakistan. He has mentored me for community relevant stuff. I would love to credit him, the person who gathered the Pakistani WordPress folks under one roof for the first time.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h3>Message for WordPressers:</h3>\n<p><em>If you seriously want to do something for yourself, do something for others first.</em></p>\n<p>Go for open source, you’ll surely learn how to code. You’ll learn how to work in a team. Join local meetups, meet with the folks: help them, learn from them and share ideas.</p>\n<h3>Wrap Up:</h3>\n<p>One thing I have learned from life is that there is no shortcut to success. You have to work hard to achieve your goals. The person who lives in a fantasy world will never succeed in life.</p>\n<p>I don’t think I have achieved something great.

The company received 33,478 responses from developers across 23 industries and 194 countries and territories. Twenty-two languages were represented and less than half of respondents spoke English (47.13%), although the survey was in English.</p>\n<p>The preview highlights essential trends in the JavaScript ecosystem. React&#8217;s growing popularity is the least surprising among these trends. The results showed that 63% of respondents are using React.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-26-at-3.15.32-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>npm Inc. estimates that there are approximately 5 million React developers worldwide and concludes that &#8220;There has never been a JavaScript framework this popular before, and it is more than twice as popular as the next-biggest framework, Angular.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Results for other frameworks are not yet available to the public but npm Inc. plans to share more details in future articles. </p>\n<p>Nearly half (49%) of respondents have more than 5 years of experience using JavaScript, a 9% increase from the previous year&#8217;s survey, shifting an estimated 1 million participants into this category. This indicates that the JavaScript user base is becoming more sophisticated overall. </p>\n<p>Another trend is the rising popularity of GraphQL. While its adoption is still relatively low, with only 7% of respondents indicating that they use it frequently, 23% of developers use it for some of their projects. The results showed that 72% of npm users are using or considering using GraphQL in 2019.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-26-at-4.36.13-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In a post that goes further in depth on <a href=\"https://medium.com/npm-inc/methodology-of-the-2018-2019-javascript-ecosystem-survey-and-results-b1cef1b83f10\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the methodology used for the survey</a>, nmp Inc. said the company did not collect demographics on race or gender identity, so the data may not be representative of the broader population of JavaScript users on these metrics.

NetBeans joins more than 350 other open source projects and initiatives managed by the foundation after spending two years in the Apache Incubator.</p>\n<p>The IDE supports Java, JavaScript, PHP, HTML5, and other popular programming languages, and is also used as a tooling platform and application framework. Although PhpStorm and Sublime Text capture a larger share of the IDE market for PHP developers, there is a small but passionate segment of WordPress developers who favor NetBeans as their IDE of choice.</p>\n<p>NetBeans started as a student project in 1996 in what was formerly known as Czechoslovakia. It was the first Java IDE written in Java but it soon became more than just an IDE platform, as the community began using it to create applications that weren&#8217;t development tools. In 2000, Sun Microsystems acquired NetBeans and open sourced it, making it Sun&#8217;s first sponsored open source project. It became part of Oracle when it acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010 and the company continues to sponsor the project. NetBeans is now used by more than 1.5 million users each month.</p>\n<p>Now that Apache NetBeans is governed by the ASF, it will be more likely to receive contributions than when it belonged to a commercial entity. However, contributors from Oracle and other organizations will continue to be part of shaping its future. Coming under the ASF umbrella is also bringing some welcome developments for the project&#8217;s governance, according to Apache NetBeans Vice President Geertjan Wielenga:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Being part of the ASF means that NetBeans is now not only free and Open Source software: it is also, uniquely, and for the first time, part of a foundation specifically focused on enabling open governance. Every contributor to the project now has equal say over the roadmap and direction of NetBeans. That is a new and historic step and the community has been ready for this for a very long time. Thanks to the strong stewardship of NetBeans in Sun Microsystems and Oracle, Apache NetBeans is now ready for the next phase in its development and we welcome everyone to participate as equals as we move forward.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oracle&#8217;s decision to submit NetBeans to the ASF Incubator came as a surprise to many in 2016. At that time, OSI President Simon Phipps <a href=\"https://meshedinsights.com/2016/09/15/oracle-gets-it-right-netbeans-heads-to-apache/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shared his thoughts</a> about the benefits he saw for the project moving to open governance under the ASF:</p>\n<blockquote><p>By moving to independent governance and losing the Oracle CLA, others can join in with confidence their contribution won’t be used against them. More importantly, contributors also no longer need fear the transient decisions of cost-cutting Oracle VPs impacting the long-term viability of the project. Oracle’s Java team still needs NetBeans in order to make tools releases supporting new capabilities in Java 9 and later, so are likely to engage. Rather than withdrawal, this looks more like leveraging the ecosystem around NetBeans to sustain development while keeping Oracle’s costs in line with the direct benefit NetBeans delivers to them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/NetBeansProposal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> submitted to the ASF for NetBeans&#8217; acceptance into the Incubator, the majority of code contributions have come from Oracle since it acquired Sun Microsystems. In addressing some of the known risks Oracle faces in contributing NetBeans to the ASF, the proposal states that &#8220;the size and diversity of the community is a guarantee against the project being orphaned.&#8221; </p>\n<p>NetBean&#8217;s proposal said the purpose of moving NetBeans to Apache is to &#8220;expand the diversity of contributors and to increase the level of meritocracy.&#8221; The project already has a good foundation to build on, as its application framework is used by large companies and organizations, including Boeing, Airbus Defense and Space, NASA, and NATO, that depend on NetBeans for building mission critical scientific software. This new era of open governance should give the community a stronger sense of ownership and stimulate greater levels of contribution across the project. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 02:18:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 Release Candidate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6909\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3119:\"<p>The first release candidate for WordPress 5.2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important milestone as we progress toward the WordPress 5.2 release date. “Release Candidate” means that the new version is ready for release, but with millions of users and thousands of plugins and themes, it’s possible something was missed.

However, more than half of all WordPress users (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">~55%</a>) are not running version 5.0+. Nearly 30% are hanging back at 4.9 and 25% are on even older versions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-23-at-10.05.35-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a> </p>\n<p>Theme authors who create products that have Gutenberg-only features are not yet building for the majority of WordPress users. These authors are carving a path for the future of theme development. The Clean Blocks theme doesn&#8217;t really fall into this category, as its essentially enables users on WordPress 5.0+ to continue using the new editor without any styling issues. It is also compatible with earlier versions of WordPress (4.8+).</p>\n<p>Clean Blocks recommends a collection of Catch Themes&#8217; functionality plugins upon theme activation. These plugins handle things like galleries, infinite scroll, Instagram feeds, widgets, and additional content types. The theme includes dozens of options in the Customizer for controlling nearly every aspect of how content is displayed &#8211; from excerpt length to categories displayed on the home page to header text color. This sort of overloaded Customizer options panel is common for multipurpose style themes, and many users have come to expect it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://catchthemes.com/demo/clean-blocks-free/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Check out a demo</a> of the free version to see all the features in action.</p>\n<p>The name &#8220;Clean Blocks&#8221; implies that the theme goes beyond the basics to customize the Gutenberg experience, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case. The vast majority of the features seen in the demo are controlled by the Customizer. For example, features like Testimonials and Services are not available as blocks. While some theme authors opt to integrate features like this by pairing their themes with block collection plugins, Catch Themes has put everything into the Customizer.</p>\n<p>Even with Gutenberg compatibility, many themes still have a disconnect between the back and frontend where certain features can only be configured in the Customizer. This fractured customization experience is one of the necessary evils for this transition time before the block editor is fully capable of handling more complex aspects of site customization.</p>\n<p>Clean Blocks is an example of a multipurpose theme that is essentially keeping it old school in terms of content customization, while providing basic Gutenberg compatibility for users who are running WordPress 5.0+. The theme is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/clean-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available on WordPress.org</a> and has already been downloaded several hundred times during its first week in the directory. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 22:46:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Laraberg, a Gutenberg Implementation for Laravel, is Now in Beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=89058\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wptavern.com/laraberg-a-gutenberg-implementation-for-laravel-is-now-in-beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3954:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/laraberg.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The family of Gutenberg derivatives is expanding with the beta release of <a href=\"https://github.com/VanOns/laraberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laraberg</a>, an implementation for Laravel. <a href=\"http://mauricewijnia.nl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Maurice Wijnia</a>, a developer at <a href=\"https://www.van-ons.nl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Van Ons</a>, an agency based in Amsterdam, created Laraberg as an easy way for developers building applications with Laravel to integrate the Gutenberg editor. It includes a simple API and support for the <a href=\"https://unisharp.github.io/laravel-filemanager/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laravel File Manager</a> for uploading files.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/laraberg-1.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal for Laraberg is to give developers the ability to add the Gutenberg editor to any page they like in a way that is as easy as possible, but at the same time it has to prove enough options to tailor the editor so it can fit into any Laravel project out there,&#8221; Wijnia said.</p>\n<p>Van Ons has a <a href=\"https://www.van-ons.nl/nieuws/gutenberg-in-laravel-hier-is-laraberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">preference for using Laravel</a> in their projects, due to its increasing popularity and active community. Laraberg makes it possible for the agency to tap into the convenience of the Gutenberg editor without giving up the performance and features they enjoy in the Laravel framework. The beta release is now available on <a href=\"https://github.com/VanOns/laraberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://packagist.org/packages/van-ons/laraberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Packagist</a>. Van Ons plans to actively implement Laraberg in their own projects and will also be collecting feedback from beta testers. </p>\n<p>Wijnia said he was inspired by the <a href=\"https://drupalgutenberg.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Gutenberg</a> project, whose creators also authored <a href=\"https://github.com/front/gutenberg-js\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg.js</a>, a package that makes it easier to bring Gutenberg into other applications. Providing a foundation for using Gutenberg on any CMS or framework is part of Frontkom&#8217;s long term vision for improving the open web and enabling communities to collaborate on mutually beneficial extensions.</p>\n<p>As the editor continues to expand to more platforms and frameworks, a CMS-agnostic block library would offer a central place for Gutenberg&#8217;s increasingly diverse user base to discover new blocks. WordPress.org has the opportunity to provide that in its own block library, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/#comment-8947\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">with the support of the Gutenberg Cloud team</a> that pioneered the idea in 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If Gutenberg Cloud can serve as a proof of concept that WP.org can later adopt as their own, we are happy,&#8221; Frontkom CTO Per Andre Rønsen said. He also further commented on the WordPress.org Block Library proposal, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-cloud-team-advocates-for-making-wordpress-orgs-new-block-directory-a-cms-agnostic-library\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">advocating for the team to grow their vision beyond the WordPress community</a> only. No official decision has been announced yet. If WordPress decides to forgo the opportunity of providing a block library inclusive of other frameworks and platforms, then the Gutenberg Cloud will continue to be the place for discovering blocks that can be used across multiple platforms.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 17:24:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"HeroPress: How the WordPress community helped me find my way\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2786\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:172:\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-the-wordpress-community-helped-me-find-my-way\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30665:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/042419-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Be the person you needed when you were younger.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#pt-br\">Este ensaio também está disponível em português.</a></p>\n<p>As I make a checklist of all the things I’ll have to pack to travel from São Paulo to Berlin, to attend WordCamp Europe 2019, I can&#8217;t stop thinking how hard the path to this point has been.</p>\n<p>For some of people, a travel like this may seem ordinary, but for me, this will be the farthest I&#8217;ve ever been until now, in many ways. Especially because the last time I was planning to attend an international WordCamp, things didn&#8217;t work out at all.</p>\n<p>So let me tell you about the path.</p>\n<h3>The first steps</h3>\n<p>I was born and raised in São Paulo. Allow me to give you some context about my city. São Paulo is the richest and biggest city of Brazil. With more than 14 million people, it&#8217;s also the biggest city of the south hemisphere. It&#8217;s even bigger than New York.</p>\n<p>Like every big city, São Paulo is a place of opportunities, but also a place of contrasts.</p>\n<p>Growing up, although we were poor, my family cared a lot about the education of me and my little brother. My father who always liked technology, managed to get a computer for us in 1996. At that time, I was 6 years old, and we were the only family in my neighborhood to have a computer for a long time, and that was sad. That early exposure to technology made a big difference in my life.</p>\n<p>At age 13, I was very interested in graphic design and coding.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had a very limited and expensive dial-up internet, that was only free after midnight and at weekends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So to learn these skills, my best options were the CD-ROM magazines that my father would bring home. I also learned about HTML with a book about Microsoft Front Page. At age 14 I sold my first website, entirely created on Front Page, with lots of GIFs and &lt;marquee&gt; tags, for a neighbour who needed it for a college project. She loved it!</p>\n<p>I decided I wanted to work with design. So I started a Graphic Design course during the high school. With my love for web design, all I wanted was to have a site that was actually online. I couldn’t afford a host, but fortunately at this time, blogs became very popular here in Brazil.</p>\n<p>I looked for a platform to create a portfolio. I played a little with one called WordPress (you may have heard of it) and ended up using Blogger instead, because there was the possibility to customize the theme’s CSS online. I made a very dark grungy theme for my blog that’s still online.</p>\n<h3>A bumpy road</h3>\n<p>I got a scholarship for Graphic Design at a good College in São Paulo, but I still would have to pay for half of the monthly tuition. The problem was that my family definitely had no means to afford it. My parents said they would cut some expenses and help me, but I knew that there wasn’t anything they could cut. So I told them to not worry, I would find a job.</p>\n<p>At this point I had made a freelance gig creating a HTML website (in Dreamweaver this time). With exactly 1 month left for the College application, this client proposed that I started working there to maintain the website I just made. So I was able to (barely) pay for the college. After six months, I applied for a full scholarship and it was granted. Things got a little better financially, but the path was still rocky.</p>\n<p>It took me 3 hours by bus from my house to the college every single day, just inside the city of São Paulo (remember when I said this city is huge?).</p>\n<blockquote><p>I had the cheapest hot dog for lunch every day, because I couldn’t afford a real meal.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then I would go to work (another 1h30 of bus from the college), and at night I would head back home (another bus, another 1h30). That was my routine for one and a half year throughout the college. As you can imagine, I was exhausted, and eventually getting ill.</p>\n<h3>A fork in the path</h3>\n<p>That’s when I decided that I would quit my job and start a business with my boyfriend Allyson Souza, that I met during my Graphic Design course in High School. We started the company officially in july, 2009. <a href=\"http://www.hastedesign.com.br/\">We named it Haste</a> (the portuguese word for “stem”).</p>\n<p>We were 19 years old, not much experience, zero network and money, a lot of energy, and some extra self-confidence (I could have summarized simply as “millennials”, right?). Allyson’s father gave us a computer and a part of his office, for which I am very grateful, and we created all the graphic materiais for his courses company in exchange.</p>\n<p>We started working with graphic design only, and it took us some time to realize that web development was our future.</p>\n<p>I remembered WordPress and tried it again. I liked how the platform had evolved. We made a second version of our website in WordPress, using a simple free theme, which I edited the CSS directly (oh god). We tried to create websites for clients modifying existing themes (at least we learned about child themes later), but we definitely didn’t feel in control of what we were doing.</p>\n<h3>When you hit your lowest point</h3>\n<p>In January 2011, my mother had a stroke. She had a brain surgery, and after a month, she was back home with a 6 inches scar in the head. That was the lowest point on my path.</p>\n<p>The next years I had to take care of her, because of some consequences of the stroke, both physical and psychological. As the only family member who hadn’t a “formal” job, with a boss and a defined schedule, I was the one who had to take her to appointments, or the ER, or stay home when she wasn’t ok. It was very hard to reconcile the final year of college, the work and my mom’s health care.</p>\n<h3>The only way is up</h3>\n<p>At Haste, we felt that things were not evolving. In 2013, after some partnerships that took us to some confusing paths, we decided to have a complete makeover. We defined a new focus: web design and development with WordPress. We created a new website, with a theme fully developed by us. We wanted to overcome the fear of coding, and wanted to know exactly what we were doing. So we started studying a lot by ourselves.</p>\n<p>Allyson was responsible for the PHP and JavaScript and I was supposed to make the design, the HTML and CSS. He started to ask a lot of questions in the group of WordPress Brasil community at Facebook. We finished the website, and people loved it, specially the illustration with parallax effect that made the girl move her eyes.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were proud WordPress developers now.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We started attending the meetups, and then the WordCamp. I was amazed how the open-source culture was all about sharing knowledge with strangers, with no fear of competition, just the spirit of collaboration. We felt no longer isolated. We made real friends (shout out to all my WordPress friends).</p>\n<p>Soon we were both involved in the community, and became WordCamp São Paulo organizers in 2014.</p>\n<p>The new website and our participation in the WordPress community were really what we needed to give us some perspective and stability. So we didn’t stop there.</p>\n<h3>Bring others to walk with you</h3>\n<p>In the 2014 edition of WordCamp São Paulo, I was the only female speaker. That made me realize a few things.</p>\n<p>First that the proportion of men in the community events was not only the majority but, we almost didn’t had any women at all, which was very weird.</p>\n<p>Second, we know that lots of girls feel intimidated in an environment with too much men. I always had a majority of male friends since I was a kid, and even so, I probably wouldn’t get involved with the community if it wasn’t by the fact that my boyfriend / partner was with me.</p>\n<p>A few sexists incidents had happened with me too. I reacted, and the men involved seemed to understand that I wasn’t ok, and changed their behavior as far as I know.</p>\n<p>We don’t have as many meetups and WordCamps here in Brazil as in US. Although Brazil is becoming a technology hub, the WordPress community has still a lot of room to grow, compared to other communities. So, I think we have the opportunity to make things different while everything is not settled yet.</p>\n<p>So I decided to act now.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I started a poll asking the women involved with WordPress the reasons why they wouldn’t attend the events. The results proved it wasn’t just me complaining about small things.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some jokes kept women away. Some condescending actions made them feel diminished. And even the lack of information from our part, that the WordCamps are inclusive events, made the women not to come. The lack of time, was an important factor too.</p>\n<p>Based on this data, the next year we managed to increase the proportion of female speakers from 5% to 32% at WordCamp São Paulo 2015. More women became organizers too. In 2019 we have 4 women out of 10 active organizers. The last WordCamp we had blind people attending, and their feedback was great. We still need to improve racial diversity though.</p>\n<h3>Barriers and frontiers</h3>\n<p>In 2015, Allyson had told me about this new scholarship program from the WordPress Foundation for women who work for equality in the community around the world. So I applied for the very first Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship. Kim Parsell left a beautiful legacy of inclusion and love, having worked to bring more women, older people, and other minorities to the WordPress community. She was known as the #WPMom.</p>\n<p>The result came few months later. I received an email, and had no reaction for a few minutes. I had won the scholarship, and it granted me a travel to WordCamp US 2015, in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, with flights and hotel covered.</p>\n<p>You see: I had never left my country. I had just took flight for the first time that same year. I was not even close to dream to go to US, because it was impossible for me at the moment. Sometimes your mindset in the only thing putting limitations in your dreams.</p>\n<p>I was so happy, you have no idea. Alx Block and Cami Kaos reached to me to give me instructions and they were very kind.</p>\n<p>But then… my visa application was denied. They considered my sudden passport and visa solicitation, with no money to travel (that’s exactly the point of a scholarship!), and lack “ties” in Brazil very suspicious. I told them that the WordPress Foundation would pay for everything. The flights and the hotel were already booked. The officer even told me that the WordPress Foundation letter could be easily forged. I tried again, with no success.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I couldn’t go to WordCamp US 2015.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I couldn’t go to WordCamp US 2016 too, when they asked if I wanted to try again, and my visa was denied&#8230; again. This time I think at least the officer searched online for me, saw it was true, but couldn’t do anything, since my situation hadn’t change.</p>\n<p>I was so disappointed. This still hurts me, I must confess. Sometimes, there are real barriers and gates that a simple mindset change cannot open.</p>\n<h3>Crossed paths</h3>\n<p>The next years, I focused on my company and the work at the community. My mom’s health improved, she’s in great shape now. My family supports my work.</p>\n<p>We became specialists in WordPress at Haste. We developed themes, plugins and sites for companies in Brazil and America. I now have a stable income and I live exclusively from my work with WordPress. We are celebrating 10 years in 2019.</p>\n<p>I traveled through Brazil because of WordPress, to speak at WordCamps and Meetups. I see more and more women working with WordPress, attending meetups and WordCamps, and talking to each other, finding something familiar in every other woman’s face.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Last year we decided we would go to WordCamp Europe 2019 in Berlin, since we don’t need a visa to most countries there, including Germany.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This time I can afford it (with a lot of planning and expenses cut, but I’ll be ok). I have to confess that I’m a little anxious about the immigration process.</p>\n<p>My goal at WordCamp Europe is to know the most people I can. It’s not a matter of quantity, but if the WordPress community taught me something was that every person has something to teach and to learn. So If you are attending WordCamp Europe, let’s meet!</p>\n<h3>Opening trails</h3>\n<p>So now I hope you can see what this travel really means to me, and why every small conquest means a lot. It’s not just because it was hard. But because I’m not the only one who deserve it, but unfortunately I’m a exception between other people who have the same background as I.</p>\n<p>There are so many young girls and boys that don’t dare to dream about visiting other countries, or even getting in the college. Lots of kids that don’t have a computer, or even access to internet. The only difference is that I was given opportunities, people believed in me. Doors were opened. And just then I could prove my value.</p>\n<p>Now my next dream is to be able to make the journey a little easier than it was for me, specially for women and young Brazilians. Because I think that’s our responsibility in the community. Teach others, share information, donate some of your time, create new tools, plugins and resources, mentor people. As my brother’s tattoo says, be the person you needed when you were younger.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pt-br\">Como a comunidade WordPress me ajudou a encontrar o meu caminho</h2>\n<p>Enquanto faço uma lista de todas as coisas que preciso para viajar de São Paulo para Berlim, para participar do WordCamp Europe 2019, não posso deixar de pensar no quão difícil foi o caminho até esse ponto.</p>\n<p>Para algumas pessoas, uma viagem como essa pode parecer comum, mas, para mim, esse será o mais longe que já fui até agora, de muitas maneiras. Especialmente porque, da última vez que eu planejava participar de um WordCamp internacional, as coisas não deram certo.</p>\n<p>Então deixe-me contar sobre esse caminho.</p>\n<h3>Os primeiros passos</h3>\n<p>Eu nasci e cresci em São Paulo. Permita-me dar um pouco de contexto sobre minha cidade. São Paulo é a mais rica e maior cidade do Brasil. Com mais de 14 milhões de pessoas, é também a maior cidade do hemisfério sul. É maior que Nova York.</p>\n<p>Como toda grande cidade, São Paulo é um lugar de oportunidades, mas também de contrastes.</p>\n<p>Crescendo, apesar de sermos pobres, minha família se importava muito com a minha educação e do meu irmão mais novo. Meu pai, que sempre gostou de tecnologia, conseguiu um computador para nós em 1996. Naquela época, eu tinha 6 anos, e éramos a única família das redondezas a ter um computador por um longo tempo, e isso era triste. Essa exposição precoce à tecnologia fez uma grande diferença na minha vida.</p>\n<p>Aos 13 anos, eu já estava interessada em design gráfico e programação. Nós tínhamos aquela internet discada muito limitada e cara, que só era gratuita depois da meia-noite e nos fins de semana. Então, para aprender essas habilidades, minhas melhores opções eram as revistas em CD-ROM que meu pai trazia para casa. Eu também aprendi sobre HTML com um livro sobre o Microsoft Front Page. Aos 14 anos, vendi meu primeiro site, inteiramente criado no Front Page, com muitos GIFs e tags &lt;marquee&gt;, para uma vizinha que precisava para um projeto da faculdade. Ela adorou!</p>\n<p>Eu decidi que queria trabalhar com design. Então fiz o curso técnico em design gráfico durante o ensino médio. Com o meu interesse pelo web design, tudo o que eu queria era ter um site que estivesse online. Eu não podia pagar um servidor, mas felizmente, neste momento, os blogs se tornaram muito populares aqui no Brasil.</p>\n<p>Procurei uma plataforma para criar um portfólio. Eu brinquei um pouco com uma plataforma chamada WordPress (você pode ter ouvido falar dela) mas acabei usando o Blogger, porque havia a possibilidade de personalizar o CSS do tema online. Eu fiz um tema escuro e grunge para o meu blog que ainda está online.</p>\n<h3>Uma estrada esburacada</h3>\n<p>Consegui uma bolsa de Design Gráfico em uma boa faculdade em São Paulo, mas ainda teria que pagar metade da mensalidade. O problema era que minha família definitivamente não tinha como arcar com isso. Meus pais disseram que cortariam algumas despesas e me ajudariam, mas eu sabia que não havia nada que pudessem cortar. Então eu disse a eles para não se preocuparem, eu encontraria um emprego.</p>\n<p>Neste momento, eu havia feito um trabalho freelancer criando um site HTML (no Dreamweaver desta vez). Com exatamente 1 mês para o aplicativo da faculdade, esta cliente propôs que eu começasse a trabalhar lá para manter o site que tinha acabado de criar. Então eu pude pagar pela faculdade (bem mal). Depois de seis meses, solicitei uma bolsa de estudos integral e ela foi concedida. As coisas melhoraram um pouco financeiramente, mas o caminho ainda era rochoso.</p>\n<p>Levava 3 horas de ônibus da minha casa para a faculdade todos os dias, apenas dentro da cidade de São Paulo (lembra quando eu disse que essa cidade é enorme?). Eu comia um cachorro-quente mais barato para o almoço todos os dias, porque eu não podia pagar uma refeição de verdade. Então eu ia trabalhar (outra 1h30 de ônibus da faculdade), e à noite eu voltava para casa (outro ônibus, outro 1h30). Essa foi a minha rotina por um ano e meio durante a faculdade. Como você pode imaginar, eu estava exausta e ficando doente.</p>\n<h3>Uma bifurcação no caminho</h3>\n<p>Foi então que decidi largar meu trabalho e começar um negócio com meu namorado Allyson Souza, que conheci durante o curso de Design Gráfico no Ensino Médio. Nós começamos a empresa oficialmente em julho de 2009. Nós a nomeamos Haste.</p>\n<p>Nós tínhamos 19 anos de idade, não muita experiência, zero networking e dinheiro, muita energia e alguma autoconfiança extra (eu poderia ter resumido simplesmente como “millennials”, certo?). O pai do Allyson nos deu um computador e uma parte de seu escritório, pelo que sou muito grata, e criamos todos os materiais gráficos para sua empresa de cursos em troca.</p>\n<p>Começamos a trabalhar apenas com design gráfico e levamos algum tempo para perceber que o desenvolvimento web era o nosso futuro.</p>\n<p>Lembrei-me do WordPress e tentei novamente. Eu gostei de como a plataforma evoluiu. Fizemos uma segunda versão do nosso site no WordPress, usando um simples tema gratuito, que eu editei diretamente o CSS (não façam isso!). Tentamos criar websites para clientes que modificando temas existentes (pelo menos aprendemos sobre temas filhos mais tarde), mas definitivamente não nos sentíamos no controle do que estávamos fazendo.</p>\n<h3>Quando você atinge seu ponto mais baixo</h3>\n<p>Em janeiro de 2011, minha mãe teve um AVC. Ela fez uma cirurgia no cérebro, e depois de um mês, ela estava em casa com uma cicatriz na cabeça. Esse foi o ponto mais baixo do meu caminho.</p>\n<p>Nos anos seguintes eu tive que cuidar dela, por causa de algumas consequências do AVC, tanto físicas quanto psicológicas. Como a única pessoa da família que não tinha um emprego “formal”, com um chefe e um horário de trabalho definido, fui eu quem teve que levá-la às consultas, ao pronto-socorro ou ficar em casa quando ela não estava bem. Foi bem difícil conciliar o último ano da faculdade, o trabalho e cuidar da saúde da minha mãe.</p>\n<h3>O único caminho é para cima</h3>\n<p>Na Haste, sentimos que as coisas não estavam evoluindo. Em 2013, após algumas parcerias que nos levaram a caminhos confusos, decidimos fazer uma reformulação completa. Definimos um novo foco: web design e desenvolvimento com WordPress. Criamos um novo site, com um tema totalmente desenvolvido por nós. Queríamos superar o medo de programar e queríamos saber exatamente o que estávamos fazendo. Então começamos a estudar muito por conta própria.</p>\n<p>Allyson ficou responsável pelo PHP e JavaScript e eu deveria fazer o design, o HTML e CSS. Ele começou a postar muitas perguntas no grupo da comunidade WordPress Brasil no Facebook. Nós terminamos o site, e as pessoas adoraram, especialmente a ilustração com efeito de paralaxe que fez a garota mover seus olhos. Nós éramos orgulhosos desenvolvedores do WordPress agora.</p>\n<p>Nós começamos a frequentar os meetups, e depois o WordCamp da comunidade WordPress. Fiquei espantada com a forma como a cultura de código aberto era toda sobre compartilhar conhecimento com estranhos, sem medo de competir, apenas o espírito de colaboração. Não nos sentíamos mais isolados. Nós fizemos amigos de verdade (alô amigos do WordPress).</p>\n<p>Logo nos envolvemos na comunidade e nos tornamos organizadores do WordCamp São Paulo em 2014.</p>\n<p>O novo site e nossa participação na comunidade WordPress foram realmente o que precisávamos para nos dar alguma perspectiva e estabilidade. Então nós não paramos por aí.</p>\n<h3>Traga os outros para caminhar com você</h3>\n<p>Na edição de 2014 do WordCamp São Paulo, eu era a única palestrante mulher. Isso me fez perceber algumas coisas.</p>\n<p>Primeiro, a proporção de homens nos eventos da comunidade não era apenas a maioria, mas quase não tínhamos nenhuma mulher. O que era muito estranho.</p>\n<p>Em segundo lugar, sabemos que muitas mulheres se sentem intimidadas em um ambiente com muitos homens. Eu sempre tive a maioria de amigos homens desde criança, e mesmo assim, eu provavelmente não me envolveria com a comunidade se não fosse pelo fato de meu namorado / sócio estar comigo.</p>\n<p>Alguns incidentes sexistas também aconteceram comigo. Eu reagi, e os homens envolvidos parecem ter entendido o problema, e mudaram seus comportamentos até onde eu sei.</p>\n<p>Não temos tantos meetups e WordCamps aqui no Brasil como nos EUA. Embora o Brasil esteja lentamente se tornando um polo de tecnologia, a comunidade WordPress ainda tem muito espaço para crescer, em comparação com outras comunidades. Então, acho que temos a oportunidade de fazer as coisas diferentes enquanto tudo ainda não está definido.</p>\n<p>Então eu decidi mudar isso.</p>\n<p>Eu comecei uma pesquisa perguntando às mulheres envolvidas com WordPress quais eram as razões pelas quais elas não compareciam aos eventos. Os resultados provaram que não era só eu reclamando de pequenas coisas.</p>\n<p>Algumas piadas mantinham as mulheres afastadas. Algumas ações condescendentes fizeram com que se sentissem diminuídas. E mesmo a falta de informação de nossa parte, de que os WordCamps são eventos inclusivos, fez com que as mulheres não viessem. A falta de tempo também foi um fator importante.</p>\n<p>Com base nesses dados, no ano seguinte conseguimos aumentar a proporção de mulheres palestrantes de 5% para 32% no WordCamp São Paulo 2015. Mais mulheres se tornaram organizadoras também. Em 2019, temos 4 mulheres de 10 organizadores ativos. No último WordCamp, tivemos deficientes visuais comparecendo e o feedback deles foi ótimo. Ainda precisamos melhorar a diversidade racial.</p>\n<h3>Barreiras e fronteiras</h3>\n<p>Em 2015, Allyson me contou sobre o novo programa de bolsas de estudos da Fundação WordPress para mulheres que trabalham pela igualdade na comunidade em todo o mundo. Então me inscrevi para a primeira bolsa Kim Parsell Memorial. Kim Parsell deixou um lindo legado de inclusão e amor, tendo trabalhado para trazer mais mulheres, pessoas mais velhas e outras minorias para a comunidade WordPress. Ela era conhecida como a #WPMom.</p>\n<p>O resultado veio alguns meses depois. Recebi um email e não tive reação por alguns minutos. Eu tinha ganhado a bolsa que me garantia uma viagem para o WordCamp US 2015, na Filadélfia, na Pensilvânia, com voos e hotel cobertos.</p>\n<p>Veja bem: eu nunca tinha saído do meu país. Eu tinha acabado de voar de avião pela primeira vez naquele mesmo ano. Eu não estava nem perto de sonhar em ir para os EUA, porque era impossível para mim no momento. Às vezes sua mentalidade na única coisa colocando limitações em seus sonhos.</p>\n<p>Eu estava tão feliz, você não faz ideia. Alx Block e Cami Kaos entraram em contato para me dar instruções e foram muito gentis.</p>\n<p>Mas então&#8230; meu pedido de visto foi negado. Eles consideraram minha solicitação repentina de passaporte e visto, sem dinheiro para viajar (esse é exatamente o ponto de uma bolsa de estudos!),  e a falta de “laços” no Brasil muito suspeitos. Eu disse a eles que a Fundação WordPress pagaria por tudo. Os voos e o hotel já estavam reservados. O oficial até me disse que a carta da Fundação WordPress poderia ser facilmente falsificada. Eu tentei de novo, sem sucesso.</p>\n<p>Eu não pude ir para o WordCamp US 2015.</p>\n<p>Eu também não pude ir ao WordCamp US 2016, quando eles perguntaram se eu queria tentar novamente, e meu visto foi negado&#8230; de novo. Desta vez, acho que pelo menos o oficial pesquisou on-line por mim, viu que era verdade, mas não conseguiu fazer nada, pois minha situação não mudara.</p>\n<p>Eu estava tão desapontada. Ainda fico triste de lembrar, devo confessar. Às vezes, existem barreiras e portões reais que uma simples mudança de mentalidade não pode abrir.</p>\n<h3>Caminhos cruzados</h3>\n<p>Nos anos seguintes, concentrei-me em minha empresa e no trabalho na comunidade. A saúde da minha mãe melhorou, ela está em ótima agora. Minha família apóia meu trabalho.</p>\n<p>Nós nos tornamos especialistas em WordPress na Haste. Desenvolvemos temas, plugins e sites para empresas no Brasil e na América. Agora tenho uma renda estável e vivo exclusivamente do meu trabalho com o WordPress. Estamos comemorando 10 anos em 2019.</p>\n<p>Eu viajei pelo Brasil por causa do WordPress, para falar em WordCamps e Meetups. Fui para Fortaleza, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Porto Alegre. Eu vejo mais e mais mulheres trabalhando com o WordPress, participando de meetups e WordCamps, e conversando, encontrando algo familiar no rosto das outras mulheres.</p>\n<p>No ano passado, decidimos que iríamos para o WordCamp Europa 2019 em Berlim, já que não precisamos de visto para a maioria dos países, incluindo a Alemanha.</p>\n<p>Desta vez, posso pagar (com muito planejamento e redução de despesas). Tenho que confessar que estou um pouco ansiosa com o processo de imigração.</p>\n<p>Meu objetivo no WordCamp Europa é conhecer o máximo de pessoas que posso. Não é uma questão de quantidade, mas se a comunidade do WordPress me ensinou algo foi que cada pessoa tem algo para ensinar e aprender. Então, se você estiver participando do WordCamp Europa, vamos nos conhecer!</p>\n<h3>Abrindo trilhas</h3>\n<p>Então agora eu espero que você possa ver o que essa viagem realmente significa para mim, e porque cada pequena conquista significa muito. Não é só porque foi difícil. Mas porque eu não sou a única que merece isso, mas infelizmente sou uma exceção entre outras pessoas que têm o mesmo histórico que eu.</p>\n<p>Há tantas meninas e meninos que não se atrevem a sonhar em visitar outros países ou até mesmo entrar na faculdade. E quando se atrevem, tem seus sonhos podados. Muitas crianças que não têm computador nem acesso à internet. A única diferença é que me foram dadas oportunidades, as pessoas acreditaram em mim. Portas foram abertas.

In an episode titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.maintainersanonymous.com/1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Speedrunning with Omnigamer</a>,&#8221; Zhu and his first guest, Eric Koziel, discuss the intricacies of &#8220;speedrunning,&#8221; playing a video game with the goal of beating it as fast as possible. Koziel describes it as a medium for doing an optimization challenge. Since the games are just software, he and Zhu explored how speedrunning intersects with coding and talked about some of the parallels with maintaining open source software.</p>\n<p>The next two episodes are a series with guest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sehurlburt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stephanie Hurlburt</a>, a graphics engineer and owner of the company that makes <a href=\"http://www.binomial.info/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Basis</a>, an image/texture compression product.

It includes CSS tree shaking improvements that restore AMP compatibility for WordPress&#8217; default Twenty Nineteen theme, reducing the size of its stylesheet by 53%.</p>\n<p>In an effort to get more users opting for the Native mode option, the plugin&#8217;s development team has rebranded the template modes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In this release the Paired mode has been rebranded as Transitional mode. One reason for this is that the classic mode was also a paired mode (where there are separate parallel URLs for the AMP version). But more importantly, the goal for this mode is to help facilitate a transition a site to being AMP-first, where there is no separate AMP-specific URLs. So the goal of the Transitional mode is to be a path to Native mode.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The team has also decided to <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/pull/2034\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rebrand Classic mode to “Reader” mode</a>, instead of deprecating it. It provides a basic AMP template for getting started that doesn&#8217;t necessarily match the site&#8217;s theme. Users can can add an “Exit Reader Mode” to the header of their sites with a setting in the Customizer.</p>\n<p>Version 1.1 introduces compatibility with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pwa/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PWA feature plugin</a>, bringing support for the service worker to AMP pages. It extends the service worker to cache AMP CDN assets, images, and Google Fonts. Since the PWA feature plugin is still under active development, the service worker integration is still considered experimental.</p>\n<p>Support for creating AMP Stories in WordPress is the next major feature coming to the plugin. A pre-release of the <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/wiki/AMP-Stories-Experimental\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AMP Stories editor</a> is available in <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/releases/tag/1.2-alpha1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1.2 alpha 1</a>, which also requires the latest version of the Gutenberg plugin.

In the past three years, Rich founded <a href=\"http://layup.media/\">a digital agency</a>, launched a popular PhotoShop <a href=\"https://purtypixels.com/\">resource site</a>, and started <a href=\"https://themebeans.com/\">ThemeBeans</a>, a successful WordPress theme shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ThemeBeans and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/coblocks/\">CoBlocks</a>, Rich&#8217;s suite of page builder blocks in a plugin, have gone with him to Godaddy. (CoBlocks remains free, and now all the ThemeBeans products are too.)  Rich took some time to reflect with us on his path so far and where he sees the WordPress ecosystem going in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What led you to dive into the new post-Gutenberg reality of WordPress and create CoBlocks and Block Gallery? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been fascinated by the block editor ever since Matias’s Gutenberg demo during WordCamp US 2017. I was instantly convinced that Gutenberg would lead us into the next era of creation in WordPress. I saw an opportunity, was in a position to execute and had enough expertise to take it on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Did sales for these products meet your expectations?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually did not release paid versions for either CoBlocks or Block Gallery. There were plans to monetize both plugins, but at the time we were focused on delivering innovative solutions to Gutenberg and pushing the editor to its extremes. Adoption-wise, both plugins grew particularly fast, and are continuing to do so. In that sense, they most certainly exceeded my expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What do you see as the near and long term future of the WordPress ecosystem? As solo developers and small firms are increasingly hired by bigger fish, especially hosting companies, will there still be a place for small entrepreneurs? </strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that the WordPress ecosystem will continue to be an innovative field for both entrepreneurs and larger companies. It’s all about innovation and being able to execute —  regardless of the size of the team behind the product or idea. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And over the last few years, the WordPress economy and its entrepreneurial leaders, have evolved into quite a mature ecosystem. I’d say the fact that companies such as GoDaddy are investing in the future of WordPress is a huge sign of that maturity and growth in our industry. Hosts, in particular, are uniquely equipped to make a huge difference in how so many folks use WordPress. Investing in products and talent that level-up the overall WordPress experience is good for us all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What about GoDaddy made it seem like a good fit or you? Did you consider any other types of companies outside the hosting space?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I flew out to Phoenix to meet the WordPress leadership team at GoDaddy and it became quite clear that they were all-in on this new future of WordPress + Gutenberg.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy has assembled a passionate and highly qualified team of folks who are hyper-focused on improving the WordPress experience and leading the next wave of innovation in this space. Joining this team and leading the efforts as the Senior Product Manager of WordPress Experience is a good and logical fit to fulfilling my personal mission to help make WordPress beautifully simpler. I knew that what we’d build would touch millions of sites and empower people all over the world to succeed online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Before GoDaddy came along, what was your plan in terms of growth and long-term sustainability?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having run a successful theme shop for a number of years, I understood the importance of having a solid plan for growth and sustainability. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My plan for both CoBlocks and Block Gallery was to release top-tiered paid versions of each, with innovative tools, blocks and design systems. Those would have likely arrived in Q3 of 2019, as our focus for the first half of the year was to innovate and grow our user base. Now I hope to continue on that same development trajectory, adding many of those same features to the current plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What is your best advice for someone who is currently independent and wants to build a small business in the WordPress space today? What are the best lessons or advice you can provide?</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, don’t let an opportunity get away from you. Learn to identify opportunities that you are perfectly suited to execute on, then dive right in. Don&#8217;t hesitate to ask for help and don’t be afraid to try something new. Learning how to learn and then taking that a step further by continuing to learn every single day, is a catalyst for enormous personal and professional growth. It’s not all about making cool stuff, it’s about challenging yourself to become the best version of yourself; the rest will fall into place. &nbsp;<br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 21:15:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.2 Will Add 13 New Icons to the Dashicon Library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88937\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-will-add-13-new-icons-to-the-dashicon-library\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2848:\"<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dashicons</a>, the WordPress admin icon font, will be getting its first <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> in three years when WordPress 5.2 ships. The library will be updated to use WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format 2), replacing the previous WOFF 1.0 format for improved compression. WOFF 1.0 will still be included in core to maintain backwards compatibility.</p>\n<p>In addition to the new font file format, Dashicons is adding 13 new icons to the library and CSS declarations for 18 icons that were previously unavailable. The additions span a range of categories, including Buddicons, Core Teams, sites, menus, social, and miscellaneous. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ncallen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nate Allen</a>, a Senior Web Engineer at 10up, is a new contributor to the Dashicons library, even though he is not a designer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress has had a &#8216;businessman&#8217; dashicon for as long as I can remember, but didn&#8217;t have a female or gender neutral version &#8211; until now!&#8221; Allen said. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Previously I worked for Firefly Partners, an agency that builds WordPress sites for nonprofits. I was working on a project for a woman&#8217;s rights organization that needed a &#8216;staff&#8217; post type. It was a little awkward explaining to them that there was a &#8216;businessman&#8217; icon we could use for free, or they could pay extra to have a custom &#8216;businesswoman&#8217; icon designed. Not a great look for WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Allen submitted a GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons/issues/285\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a>, to see if someone would be willing to create a &#8220;businesswoman&#8221; and &#8220;businessperson&#8221; icon, but nobody had the time. Dashicons is maintained by a volunteer team and it can take a long time to get new icons designed. </p>\n<p>&#8220;About 5-6 months later I learned how to use Illustrator to create vector icons and submitted the icons myself,&#8221; Allen said. He <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/dashicons/pull/323\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">submitted the PR</a> and the new icons he created will be included in the next release of WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/business-people-icons.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>These business people icons are useful for projects that include creating things like custom post types for bios, testimonials, team members, and job postings.

In the meantime, lookup tables provide a structured index for product data that speeds up querying. This version also brings improvements to transient invalidation, changes to REST API initialization, caching improvements, and more.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce developer Timmy Crawford highlighted a few frontend performance improvements in the 3.6 release post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 62% improvement in the load time when ordering and filtering products</li>\n<li>Reduced overall load time by bypassing inactive webhooks</li>\n<li>Reduced the load time for pages with category or product attribute lists</li>\n<li>Reduced load time of product pages with attributes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release also includes the controversial new <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-6-rc2-removes-marketplace-suggestions-from-product-listing-adds-setting-to-turn-them-off\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">marketplace suggestions</a> that advertise official extensions inside the WooCommerce admin.

It was <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/14898\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">renamed</a> to avoid confusion with the HTML5 section element and prevent potential overlap with future site/theme type sections, such as headers, sidebars, and footers. The first iteration of the Group block supports the ability to nest other blocks inside it and the ability to align the block and any of its child blocks that include alignment settings. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-17-at-12.41.22-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a minimal version at the moment and improvements about the flows to add inner blocks, group/ungroup blocks are expected in follow-up releases,&#8221; Gutenberg phase 2 technical lead Riad Benguella said. In testing the feature I found that it is indeed a rocky start and far from intuitive to use but a more refined grouping experience will be developed after further testing and feedback.</p>\n<p>The Group block lays the foundation for a future where WordPress themes may evolve to become block templates. In response to a comment about how the Group block could essentially replace the widget management interface, Benguella offered a glimpse of how Gutenberg will eventually transform the theme industry:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a world where themes are made of block templates instead of php templates, there’s no need for widget areas.</p>\n<p>That said, Gutenberg is a huge change for WordPress and its community. With the new blocks concept, Phase 2 is about helping the WordPress community adopt this new concept without completely changing what a theme means in WordPress. We shouldn’t just abandon existing themes and switch into full-site editing without an iterative plan.</p>\n<p>We’ll eventually get there where everything is made of block templates and blocks but we need to make smaller steps first and the first one is the ability to use blocks instead of widgets in existing themes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gutenberg 5.5 also adds the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14445\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">image fill option</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/13989\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vertical alignment</a> support to the Media and Text blocks. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/media-text-vertical-align-small-1.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release also includes a few minor but useful improvements, such as automatically populating the link field when the selected text is an email.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/email-linked.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team is also making progress on the new widgets screen with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/14612\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">barebones testing version</a> in place that will allow them to start investigating and tackling technical issues related to this screen. It&#8217;s not functional yet but provides a place to further explore the block editor in this context.</p>\n<p>The bug fixes included in Gutenberg 5.5 will be in the upcoming WordPress 5.2 release, which was previously targeted for April 30.

Till now I was living my life with my own surroundings, now it will be no more that much of hidden.</p>\n<p>I am a very simple person from Kolkata, India. I started my career with IBM ACE i.e an IBM education wing, as a Technical Teacher. I used to teach my students several subjects like C,C++, Perl and PHP. Although I was teaching many subjects my focus was in PHP starting from 2003. In the early days of 2009 I came to know about WordPress. From the first few days I was struggling with the Administrative panel and other services.</p>\n<p>In 2009 end I decided to step down from my job and started differently. I started development work and also continue teaching the students.</p>\n<p>I was decided to develop the websites and web applications with the WordPress only, and I got the version called `Carmen` 2.9 which was a relief for me to handle the CMS. I got some help from my students and friends who were engaged in WordPress development at that time. They teach me how I can handle the WordPress more proficient way. I learnt how to develop WordPress themes, started developing the plugins.</p>\n<h3>Working with WordPress</h3>\n<p>I started developing the website using WordPress from 2010 onwards. Later on 2014 I started developing WordPress theme for the Themeforest Market place. I also started developing the plugins which helps my development process to run smoothly.</p>\n<h3>How it changed My life</h3>\n<p>My life started changing from 2010 when I started developing with WordPress. The instability of my life was changed into a stable life, which was beyond my expectation. I was living a good life with my family. What else I can expect from WordPress.</p>\n<h3>What’s Different</h3>\n<p>Apart from developing the Websites and other application, I started my research on how the development process can be more smoother and flexible. I started working on WP CLI to developing the automated process for WordPress. I developed a script that helps developers to install the WordPress flawlessly using WP CLI. My linux knowledge also helped me to write shell scripts. The script can be found in my account at github. I am also trying to get into the easy deployment process with CI/CD for the developers using Bitbucket Pipeline and AWS.</p>\n<p>I slowly become an expert on the theme approval guidelines of Themeforest Market place. Apart from that I started writing blogs on the various topics related to WordPress. Achieved almost 3K reputation in StackOverflow. Developed Plugins in wordpress.org.</p>\n<h3>WordPress.org</h3>\n<p>Even though I was developed many plugins and theme I never thought of uploading that in wordpress.org. I start realizing that to help many more people in WordPress, wordpress.org will be a better place than StackOverflow.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Kolkata</h3>\n<p>I joined Kolkata WordPress Community who was planning the WordCamp Kolkata, and thankfully they have selected me as a volunteer. Mr Subrata Sarkar( WordPress Core Contributor ) and the team who recognized me and give a huge responsibilities in WordCamp Kolkata 2019. It was again a tremendous experiences with WordPress. Since that was my first WordCamp I tried to fulfill my responsibilities. Become a Volunteer I learnt to be more polite and more decent to the people, make many more friends from different regions and countries.</p>\n<h3>My Inspirations</h3>\n<p>There are many people who inspired and helped me during my journey, its small tribute to them by mentioning a few : Abhik Goswami, Sneh Sagar Prajapati, Prabhas Chowdhury, Debobrata Debnath, Prosenjit Manna, Sk. Shamim Ullah, Soumit Pal, Subrata Sarkar.</p>\n<h3>My Words</h3>\n<p>Be polite to others. Be friendly to your Juniors and fellow developers. Try to teach them rather pointing to the mistakes. Attend Meetups. Contribute to the Community. Think what new you have done, and what new can be.</p>\n<p>Stay healthy, stay fit with WordPress <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"bangla\">WordPress এবং স্থিতিশীলতা, বাংলা তে পড়ুন</h2>\n<p>WordPress র সাথে পরিচয় ২০০৯ এর December এ, শুরু থেকেই ভালো লাগা.

The company is protesting the moderators&#8217; actions by publishing zero-day vulnerabilities (those for which no patch has been issued) and then attempting to contact the plugin author via the WordPress.org support forums:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Due to the moderators of the WordPress Support Forum’s <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/27/wordpress-team-didnt-notify-developer-of-plugin-with-700000-active-installations-about-vulnerability-they-knew-about/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">continued</a> <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-engaged-in-cover-up-of-security-issues-in-wordpress-plugins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">inappropriate</a> <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-stop-people-from-getting-help-so-they-can-promote-favored-security-companies/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">behavior</a> we are <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">full disclosing vulnerabilities in protest until WordPress gets that situation cleaned up</a>, so we are releasing this post and then only trying to notify the developer through the WordPress Support Forum. You can notify the developer of this issue on the forum as well. Hopefully the moderators will finally see the light and clean up their act soon, so these full disclosures will no longer be needed (we hope they end soon).</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the linked incidents cited above, Grillot claims that moderators have deleted his comments, covered up security issues instead of trying to fix them, and promoted certain security companies for fixing hacked sites, among other complaints. </p>\n<p>In response, Plugin Vulnerabilities has published a string of vulnerabilities with full disclosure since <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">initiating the protest</a> in September 2018. These posts detail the exact location of the vulnerabilities in the code, along with a proof of concept. The posts are followed up with an attempt to notify the developer through the WordPress.org support forum.</p>\n<p>Grillot said he hopes to return to Plugin Vulnerabilities&#8217; previous policy of responsible disclosure but will not end the protest until WordPress.org support forum moderators comply with the list of what he <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">outlined</a> as &#8220;appropriate behavior.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; security leadership is currently going through a transitional period after Aaron Campbell, head of WordPress Ecosystem at GoDaddy, stepped down from his position as head of security in December 2018. Automattic Technical Account Engineer Jake Spurlock is coordinating releases while the next person to wrangle the team is selected. This announcement was made in the #security channel, but Josepha Haden said there are plans for a more public post soon. Campbell did wish to publish the details of why he stepped down but said that he thinks it is important to rotate that role and that &#8220;the added influx of fresh energy in that position is really healthy.&#8221; </p>\n<p>When asked about the Plugin Vulnerabilities&#8217; protest against WordPress.org, Spurlock referenced the <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Responsible Disclosure guidelines</a> on WordPress&#8217; Hackerone profile. It includes the following recommendation regarding publishing vulnerabilities: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Give us a reasonable time to correct the issue before making any information public. We care deeply about security, but as an open-source project, our team is mostly comprised of volunteers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Spurlock said that since those guidelines are more pertinent to core, dealing with third-party plugins is a trickier scenario. Ideally, the plugin author would be notified first, so they can work with the plugins team to push updates and remove old versions that may contain those vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress open-source project is always looking for responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities,&#8221; Spurlock said. &#8220;We have a process for disclosing for <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/plugin-security/reporting-plugin-security-issues/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">plugins</a> and for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">core</a>. Neither of theses processes include posting 0-day exploits.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Grillot did not respond to our request for comment, but the company&#8217;s recent blog posts contend that following responsible disclosure in the past would sometimes lead to vulnerabilities being &#8220;covered up,&#8221; and even at times <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-engaged-in-cover-up-of-security-issues-in-wordpress-plugins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cause them to go unfixed</a>.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org support forum moderators do not permit people to report vulnerabilities on the support forums or to engage in discussion regarding vulnerabilities that remain unfixed. The preferred avenue for reporting is to email plugins@wordpress.org so the plugins team can work with authors to patch plugins in a timely way.</p>\n<p>However, in the wild west world of plugins, which includes more than 55,000 hosted on WordPress.org, there are times when responsible disclosure falls apart and occasionally fails users. Responsible disclosure is not a perfect policy, but overall it tends to work better than the alternative. The Plugin Vulnerabilities service even states that they intend to return to responsible disclosure after the protest, essentially recognizing that this policy is the best way to coexist with others in the plugin ecosystem. </p>\n<p>In the meantime, publishing zero-day vulnerabilities exposes sites to potential attacks if the plugin author is not immediately available to write a patch. The only thing WordPress.org can do is remove the plugin temporarily until a fix can be released. This measure protects new users from downloading vulnerable software but does nothing for users who already have the plugin active. If site owners are going to protect themselves by disabling it until there is a fix, they need to know that the plugin is vulnerable. </p>\n<p>Plugin Vulnerabilities&#8217; controversial protest, which some might even call unethical, may not be the most inspired catalyst for improving WordPress.org&#8217;s approach to security. It is a symptom of a larger issue. WordPress needs strong, visible security leadership and a team with dedicated resources for improving the plugin ecosystem. Plugin authors need a better notification system for advising users of important security updates inside the WordPress admin. Most users are not subscribed to industry blogs and security services &#8211; they depend on WordPress to let them know when an update is important. Refining the infrastructure available to plugin developers and creating a more streamlined security flow is critical for repairing the plugin ecosystem&#8217;s reputation. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 03:37:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"WPTavern: WordCamp for Publishers is Coming to Columbus, OH, August 7-9, Call for Speakers Now Open\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88366\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-for-publishers-is-coming-to-columbus-oh-august-7-9-call-for-speakers-now-open\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2696:\"<p>The third edition of WordCamp for Publishers will be held in Columbus, OH, August 7-9, 2019, at the <a href=\"https://vuecolumbus.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vue Columbus</a>.

The app helps users challenge their &#8220;automatic thoughts,&#8221; a term that refers to thoughts that come to a person spontaneously in response to a trigger, which can often be negative.</p>\n<p>Quirk lets users record a quick thought and will automatically narrow down a list of potential ways these thoughts are distorted. The distortions were inspired by the ones popularized in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009UW5X4C/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy</a>. The user is then invited to challenge those distortions and write an alternative thought.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cZMMRywMDBL\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cldup.com/5f9Qce5NQW.gif?resize=627%2C667&ssl=1\" alt=\"Quirk demo\" width=\"627\" height=\"667\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/flaqueEau\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Evan Conrad</a>, a software engineer at Segment, created Quirk as a non-commercial, personal project to make it easy for people to take control of their irrational thoughts using a common CBT technique. Quirk is not a substitute for a trained therapist but rather a tool for people to use on their own. Left unchecked, negative automatic thoughts can become emotional weights and lead to distorted thinking. Quirk is a simple app that helps people experience the world in a less negative way and develop more rational thinking patterns. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s super useful for day-to-day stuff,&#8221; Conrad said in <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19589700\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">response</a> to comments on Hacker News. &#8220;Take a thought like &#8216;<em>I took too many hints in that interview question</em>.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That thought might lead to <em>&#8216;I must have failed that interview,&#8217;</em> which leads to <em>&#8216;I’ll fail all the rest of my interviews,&#8217;</em> which leads to <em>&#8216;I’ll never get another job,&#8217;</em> which leads to <em>&#8216;I must be really bad at this, I should just give up.&#8217;</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Each step seemed kind of logical at the time, but one thought led to the next and now you feel awful.</p>\n<p>&#8220;CBT is a counter measure to this; it stops you at that first point and gives you a bunch of common logical fallacies that help you recognize why your thought is overreaching. You don’t know if you really flunked that interview, besides flunking one is good practice to pass the next one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Conrad said these types of thought processes aren&#8217;t exactly a mental health issue but are common struggles for many people. Quirk can be a useful tool for anyone looking to recognize and remove their own cognitive biases.</p>\n<p>The iOS version of the app currently works better than the Android one, as the author said he doesn&#8217;t have an Android phone and finds it difficult to support the app on that platform. However, fixes are being pushed out regularly and many of the issues with crashing are getting resolved.</p>\n<h3>How the GPL Protects Users in Mental Health Tech</h3>\n<p>The code for Quirk can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/Flaque/quirk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and is open source under the GPL-3.0, which is not a popular choice for licensing mobile apps. I asked Conrad why he opted for the GPL license, as opposed to other popular open source licenses. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Mental Health tech is a really weird world,&#8221; Conrad said. &#8220;There’s a lot of folks who want to do the right thing, but end up doing really sketchy stuff. </p>\n<p>&#8220;For example, a lot of apps collect the thoughts you’re recording for ML (Machine Learning) or NLP (Natural Language Processing). The stated purpose of this is to help better identify suicide, depression, etc. Partially because of the subject matter, many apps aren’t clearly telling their users that this is happening.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So what ends up happening is a bunch of well intended researchers get access to your most sensitive thoughts. Which is fine, but they frequently aren’t aware of how valuable of a target they’re holding to a nefarious actor. Because it’s not like a database of passwords or credit card numbers, they tend to not think about security. </p>\n<p>&#8220;But thoughts are super valuable and dangerous for abusers and blackmailers; plus most people would rather give you their password in plaintext than show you their mental health thoughts. </p>\n<p>&#8220;So if I made Quirk MIT, I would worry that someone would take Quirk and launch their own version for research that tracks and stores user thoughts. Because the license doesn’t follow them, they could do it without telling a user and there would be little way for an average person to /know/ that this is happening.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Conrad has taken an inspiring, user-centric approach to licensing and privacy that ensures users of his app (and any derivatives) will have access to the code and a better understanding of where their data is being stored. In a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flaqueEau/status/1114575448485191681\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter thread</a>, he outlined the privacy principles that underpin Quirk&#8217;s architecture:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In Quirk, FOSS and privacy isn&#8217;t a focus, it&#8217;s a given. Outside the tech world, Quirk is not trying to be a FOSS CBT app, it&#8217;s trying to be a really good CBT app that happens to be FOSS. It&#8217;s not coming out and saying &#8220;hey we don&#8217;t store your deepest darkest secrets on some server somewhere.&#8221; User&#8217;s don&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s a given. It doesn&#8217;t store things on the device because it&#8217;s trying to sell you on privacy, it does it because it&#8217;s the correct engineering decision. </p>\n<p>Regular people don&#8217;t look at the Golden Gate bridge and think about the structural quality of the bolts. They pull out their phones and take a picture. The responsibility of software is to make things frictionless and reduce the stuff someone has to think about before buying in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Conrad said he would like to see other developers build things using the app and conduct research, as long as they do so ethically. The project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/flaque/quirk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repo</a> has a detailed writeup of its design and engineering logic. It includes specific goals the code was built around in order to respect users&#8217; privacy and mental health, such as: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Thoughts are more valuable than passwords, treat them that way.</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>Be extremely cautious about making engagement your core metric.</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong><em>But be clear and obvious within the app about what&#8217;s going on with the user&#8217;s data.</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;I really do want to see people use Quirk for research,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I just want it to follow more ethical practices of consent and data security. Someone should willingly give a researcher their thoughts and as little information should be given about the person as possible. When it’s stored, it should be stored safely and not on a publicly exposed DB for example. But for that to happen, it has to be open.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Beyond GPL-specific licensing, making the app open source has many other benefits. Quirk has already been translated into six different languages. One of the byproducts of making a useful app open source is that it energizes contributors and speeds up the process of bringing the app to new audiences. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I cannot express how absolutely amazing it is that Quirk was translated into 6 languages in just a few days. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f525.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f64c.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/2665.png\" alt=\"♥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f44f.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p>&mdash; Evan Conrad (@flaqueEau) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flaqueEau/status/1115843899594084352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 10, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Feedback on the app so far has been mostly positive. One commenter on Hacker News <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19589889\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thanked</a> Conrad for open sourcing the app because he wasn&#8217;t able to continue in-person CBT due to the cost:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve been through CBT and stopped because of the cost. I feel that an app like this can complement those of us that have had face to face time but stopped for whatever reason.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Quirk is an inspiring example of how open source software can help people with every day problems.

Creator and maintainer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonbahl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Bahl</a> put the project up on <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/wp-graphql\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Open Collective</a> last week after people frequently asked how the community can support the project. WPGraphQL already has five backers, an $800 balance, and an estimated annual budget of $2,687.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Large well-known sites such as <a href=\"http://qz.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">qz.com</a> and <a href=\"http://theplayerstribune.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">theplayerstribune.com</a> are in production with JavaScript front-ends that consume data from WordPress via WPGraphQL,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;PostLight Studio maintains a popular &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/postlight/headless-wp-starter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Headless WP Starter</a>&#8221; project that initially started as a React + REST API boilerplate, but recently added WPGraphQL support as well.&#8221; </p>\n<p>One of the most important signs of the project&#8217;s growth are the extensions that developers are building on top of it, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/ashhitch/wp-graphql-yoast-seo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for Yoast SEO</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pristas-peter/wp-graphql-gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for Gutenberg</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Quartz/wp-graphql-content-blocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL Content Blocks</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields</a> is getting very close to an initial release and Caldera Forms is also <a href=\"https://github.com/CalderaWP/Caldera-Forms/issues/3149\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exploring integrations with WPGraphQL</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The two most-searched things on <a href=\"http://WPGraphQL.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL.com</a> are &#8220;Advanced Custom Fields&#8221; and &#8220;WooCommerce,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;People are interested in using WPGraphQL with other popular WordPress projects, and WPGraphQL for WooCommerce is a reaction to the folks that are already looking for alternatives to the WooCommerce REST API.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WPGraphQL for WooCommerce Seeks $15K in Funding</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/wp-graphql-woocommerce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL for WooCommerce</a> is an extension created by Geoffry Taylor that has started to gain some traction. Taylor is a core contributor to the main WPGraphQL plugin. He has just published <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kidunot89/wpgraphql-woocommerce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a Kickstarter to help fund development</a> of the extension and Bahl is consulting with him on implementation details and code reviews. </p>\n<p>Taylor began contributing to the WPGraphQL project last year after discovering the repository and finding that it lacked the features he needed. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I was looking for a solution that would allow me to create React-Apollo JS apps that could be used as WordPress themes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the solution couldn&#8217;t rely on a node server, because a large portion of my clients use shared hosting. WPGraphQL was a perfect fit for what I needed, but it lacked the features I needed at the time. This led to me contributing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since then Taylor has also created other libraries and tools that work directly or indirectly with WPGraphQL, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/wp-graphql-composer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL Composer</a>, a React-Apollo component library, and <a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/oil-based-boilerplate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oil-Based Boilerplate</a>, a boilerplate for developing React-powered WordPress themes, plugins, and guten-blocks that use shared components.</p>\n<p>Taylor is seeking $15K in funding for development of the WPGraphQL WooCommerce extension, which would enable him to apply 100% of his time to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The question I think a lot of people have, is what does this extension provide that WPGraphQL and WooCommerce doesn&#8217;t already?&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;It adds WooCommerce support to the WPGraphQL server. It is being designed to match and increase the functionality of WooCommerce REST to make it as easy as possible to convert your app from the WooCommerce REST API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor said the extension is past the initial explorations and is well into development. If a developer follows the instructions in the README they will be able to query products and their variations, coupons, orders, refunds, customer information, and (after the next update), order items from the WPGraphQL endpoint. He said that with the exception of products, none of the data is queryable for any user without shop-manager level capabilities. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Customer-level functionality is the target goal right now, meaning customers can register/login, update the cart, and checkout,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>\n<p>Anyone interested can follow the project&#8217;s progress on <a href=\"https://github.com/kidunot89/wp-graphql-woocommerce\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> or get involved on Slack at <a href=\"http://wp-graphql.slack.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wp-graphql.slack.com</a> in the #woocommerce channel.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 22:49:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WordSesh Returns May 22, 2019, Speaker Application Deadline is April 19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/wordsesh-returns-may-22-2019-speaker-application-deadline-is-april-19\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1978:\"<p>The next edition of <a href=\"https://wordsesh.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordSesh</a> is scheduled for Wednesday, May 22, 2019, from 10am-8pm EDT (UTC-4) &#8211; just a little over one month away.

Some even felt blindsided by the original implementation. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Last week, the release candidate was running on my staging server, and out of nowhere, I noticed these ads being inserted inline with the rest of the WC admin list tables,&#8221; Tobin Fekkes said. &#8220;What a shock that was! I thought I’d developed a bad case of malware or something. What nasty plugin was corrupting my core, default products table, order table, etc?! Oh, just core WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have never once gone looking to add a plugin to my site by starting at the &#8216;Products&#8217; tab. Because it doesn’t belong there. If I want to install an extension or plugin, I will go to the (aptly named) &#8216;Extensions&#8217; tab or “Plugins” tab.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is rather telling that we as longtime developers who attend every Dev chat, bookmark and check this Dev blog daily, and test all your betas and release candidates STILL had no idea about this blatant abuse of trust.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Todd Wilkens, Head of WooCommerce, addressed the issue of marketplace suggestions seeming to come out of nowhere in a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-6-to-add-marketplace-suggestions-despite-overwhelmingly-negative-feedback-from-developer-community#comment-285682\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">comment</a> on our recent post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are committed to working with our community, including the plugin review team, and responding to feedback. Just as a reminder, the Marketplace Suggestions feature was developed in the open in a long-running feature branch/PR which was merged to master a month ago. It was mentioned in the Beta 1 Release notes, and was testable during Beta1 and prior on master.</p>\n<p>It is often only when the release candidate comes out that we get certain kinds of feedback. It’s an important stage in the development cycle when we want and expect input. With the 3.6 RC1 live, we received specific feedback that we could take into consideration and act on. Thanks to the developers, end users, and the plugin review team for all their help.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WooCommerce 3.6 RC2 doesn&#8217;t make any changes to the frequency with which users will need to dismiss the ads. Some have commented that it is more like &#8220;snoozing&#8221; the ads, since they require dismissal every day for five days, only to return every month thereafter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We continue to be in contact with the plugin review team to ensure the suggestions are in accordance with the guidelines,&#8221; Wilkens said. &#8220;There is a live conversation on the definition of suggestion/advert dismissibility. We will participate in that conversation and honor the outcomes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As this implementation of marketplace suggestions still is not satisfactory to many WooCommerce users and developers, a plugin for turning off has already been submitted and approved in the WordPress plugin directory. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/surbma-woocommerce-without-marketplace-suggestions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce Without Marketplace Suggestions</a> removes the suggestions permanently without users having to continually dismiss them. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 20:18:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"HeroPress: Firefighter to Web Developer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2735\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:130:\"https://heropress.com/essays/firefighter-to-web-developer/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=firefighter-to-web-developer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13123:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041019-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I wouldn\'t be anything without the help of those around me.\" /><p>I’m jolted awake to the sound of the tones going off in my room. I knew that I hadn’t been asleep long because we’d already run a late call and it was still dark outside. Running to the truck, I hear the address come out over the radio for a medical call. It’s the third time this week we’ve been called to the same house.</p>\n<p>My driving is on autopilot because I know the city streets like the back of my hand. Not only had I worked in the same fire department for the last 6 years, but I’d also grown up in this city. On this and many other times I’d been woken up in the middle of the night, I’m starting to realize that I’m losing my passion for the job I once loved.</p>\n<h3>How I Got Into Firefighting</h3>\n<p>At 19 years old I was working in fast food, and I knew I needed to do something more with my life. I wasn’t really keen on going to college just yet, so I started looking for jobs that only needed vocational school. Knowing that I wouldn’t be a very good police officer, I signed up for fire school.</p>\n<p>During fire school I found the only way to get a job as a firefighter in Florida was to also be an EMT in order to run medical calls, so I enrolled in there as well. While I was in school, one of the instructors I met told me their department was taking on volunteers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Six years in the field, a year of paramedic school, and many sleepless nights later, I’m driving to a call feeling trapped in a career that I don’t care for anymore.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One of the perks of being a firefighter is that in between calls the free time is ours to do what we like, we just need to be ready to leave at a moment’s notice. Some of the time we watch movies and play video games, but I wanted that time to do something productive that I could turn into an opportunity for a side gig.</p>\n<h3>Why I Chose Web Developer</h3>\n<p>I stumbled across a YouTube video that demonstrated how to create a webpage with HTML. I loaded a page that stereotypically read “Hello World” and I was hooked. I didn’t even own a computer at this time in my life, but my wife had a MacBook Air. She was nice enough to let me borrow it so I could keep learning. Downloading a text editor, I started creating web pages and loading them up in a browser. Though, as I was creating these pages, it was pretty obvious there weren&#8217;t any live websites out there that looked as bad as what I was creating.</p>\n<p>While going through YouTube looking for more tutorials, I kept seeing videos for this thing called WordPress in the sidebar. Curiosity got the better of me and I clicked on one of the videos. I saw how pages were being created from an admin background and how themes changed the look of sites, while plugins added functionality. I was completely blown away.</p>\n<p>By this time, I had purchased a $250 Chromebook I was running Linux from, and I decided that I was going to run a local development environment on this little computer with a 16GB hard drive. I managed to succeed, and with each accomplishment I had, I found that I was becoming extremely passionate about building these little websites.</p>\n<h3>Meeting Other Humans</h3>\n<p>I knew that I wasn’t going to make it very far past the beginning stages without help from someone other than a search engine. Though without any knowledge of the community and how they would act towards me, going to a local meetup was something that made me very uncomfortable. I thought the second they caught a glimpse of my Chromebook and my silly beginner questions they’d have me out the door before I could sit down.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Even in the parking lot before my first meetup, I was sitting in my car telling myself that I should just drive home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When I walked into the meetup I was surprised to find people in all stages of their growth with WordPress. There were even people that knew less than me, and they were accepted just as much as I was. It was there I learned about this event called a WordCamp. I knew that whatever it was, I needed to be there and it was only two months away.</p>\n<h3>First WordCamp</h3>\n<p>Sitting in my car in front of my first WordCamp Orlando, I felt the same feelings that I did before my first meetup. I reminded myself how welcoming the meetup was, and that this wasn’t going to be any different. When I grabbed my seat in the main auditorium, I started feeling pretty strongly that I was alone in a room of 300 people. There were business owners that could actually make money off WordPress, and it felt that there weren’t many people at my experience level. As I went from talk to talk, the topics flew over my head and I became very overwhelmed. I told myself that I was going to stick it out till lunch and that I could go home after if I wanted.</p>\n<p>Lunch came and as I was walking around looking for a good place to sit, I noticed a familiar face sitting at a table with no one next to him. Up until now, I had been learning exclusively at Lynda.com and Treehouse. I was learning to use the Genesis Framework and took a couple courses by an instructor named <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/freed-from-the-soil-lab/\">Jesse Petersen</a>, and this guy looked just like him. Walking up next to him I said: “I’m sure you’ve heard this before, but you look just like an instructor I learned from on Treehouse.” He laughed and said that he was indeed that instructor from Treehouse.</p>\n<p>The pitch of my voice shot up an octave, and I started fanning out over how I had learned so much from him and asked if I could eat with him. While we ate, I told him that I was a firefighter and how I also wanted to become a web developer and build websites. By the end of the lunch, he told me that he saw something in me and that he wanted to mentor me if I was ok with that. Was I ok with that?!? Of course, I was ok with that! I was doing my best to sound cool all the while I’m absolutely ecstatic on the inside.</p>\n<p>The rest of the day I followed him around to talks, and while I was listening, he was setting up my computer with tools to help get me set up for further development. He added me to his Slack channel and told me that we were going to be working together remotely. When the day finished he asked me where we were having dinner in between the last session and the after-party.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve never gone from feeling so out of place somewhere to then feeling so welcomed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was talking to a person that had absolutely no gain from helping me out, yet spent the entirety of his day getting me set up to work with him in the future.</p>\n<p>Jesse wasn’t feeling well the next day due to an illness he had called Cystic Fibrosis. He said that he would keep up with me through the day on Slack though. Whenever I felt like I didn’t belong I would look at the tools Jesse had installed on my computer and the Slack channel and would remember that I was welcome. I was going to be learning some awesome stuff, and now I had a mentor.</p>\n<h3>Gettin&#8217; Paid</h3>\n<p>I spent the next few months going to two other WordCamps learning as much as I could and meeting as many people as possible. After going down to WordCamp Miami, I got approached by a local agency owner at a meetup that had some extra work I could help out with. Little did I know, they were also friends with Jesse and he had told them about me and what I’d been learning. This gave me a chance to get my feet wet and build some very strong friendships with some amazing people. I was now making money doing what I loved.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Four months later I got a Slack message from one of my friends telling me that Jesse had passed away.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was on shift at the fire department that day, and I felt like someone had hit me with a bat. He was due to get new lungs any time, and just the day before was telling me how he was going to start a new life once he had the strength of new lungs to do so. We were all crushed to hear of his passing. I knew it was going to be hard moving forward without him, but I knew that’s what he would have wanted.</p>\n<h3>Keynote Presentation</h3>\n<p>I continued working on my skills until I was asked to do a keynote presentation at WordCamp Orlando. The very WordCamp I’d thought about leaving halfway through just a year before. The owner of the agency I was working for, Chris Edwards, told me they’d had a speaker back out and they needed someone to fill in, so they asked <i>me</i>. They wanted me to tell my story of how I had gotten into the WordPress community. I agreed, believing it was only going to a small room full of people, but when I said yes, I was then told I would be giving the opening keynote address in front of the entire WordCamp. I had already said yes, so now there was no way that I could back down and tell him no.</p>\n<p>As I was standing on stage waiting to be introduced, I was relieved to find there was a podium. Now no one could see my legs shaking as I stood there for an hour. I could now put all my focus on making sure the hand holding the microphone stayed steady. My talk was on the past year that had led me to this point and all of the fears and vulnerabilities I’d faced. If there was someone that was feeling the way I had a year ago, I wanted them to know that they were welcome and I was excited to have them there.</p>\n<h3>Leaving the Fire Service</h3>\n<p>The rest of the weekend passed, and I got a message from my friend Chris Edwards telling me that a company that makes a donation plugin called Give was looking for a support technician. Matt Cromwell, who was about to be my new boss, was sitting in the audience while I gave my keynote presentation. I filled out the application and got a response back that he wanted to set up an interview.</p>\n<p>A year has passed since that time, and I’ve grown so much in my knowledge of web development, website management, and WordPress. I’ve just started my first business as a freelance WordPress developer, and again I’m feeling the same fears, excitement, and vulnerabilities I felt every time I started to push myself. It’s now to the point where I almost keep a lookout for the fear because I know that something amazing is going to happen on the other side.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m always going to remember the compassion that Jesse Petersen had for me, and remember to pay that kindness forward in helping others.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There’s no way I could have planned this path for myself even if I’d tried. I know that I’m in the right place now, because every day I wake up I’m happy that I get to work with WordPress and interact with this awesome community. I wouldn’t be anything without the help of those around me, and I will always be grateful for everything they’ve done.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Firefighter to Web Developer\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Firefighter%20to%20Web%20Developer&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffirefighter-to-web-developer%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Firefighter to Web Developer\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffirefighter-to-web-developer%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Ffirefighter-to-web-developer%2F&title=Firefighter+to+Web+Developer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Firefighter to Web Developer\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/firefighter-to-web-developer/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/041019-min-150x150.jpg&description=Firefighter to Web Developer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Firefighter to Web Developer\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/firefighter-to-web-developer/\" title=\"Firefighter to Web Developer\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/firefighter-to-web-developer/\">Firefighter to Web Developer</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 12:00:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Sam Smith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: GoDaddy Acquires ThemeBeans, CoBlocks, Block Gallery, and Block Unit Tests\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88673\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-themebeans-coblocks-block-gallery-and-block-unit-tests\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4970:\"<p>GoDaddy has acquired <a href=\"https://coblocks.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a>, <a href=\"https://themebeans.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ThemeBeans</a>, <a href=\"https://wpblockgallery.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Block Gallery</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-unit-test\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Block Unit Tests</a>, one of the leading Gutenberg product lines in the WordPress ecosystem. Founder Rich Tabor is joining GoDaddy as Senior Product Manager of WordPress Experience and will lead a team dedicated to understanding users&#8217; needs and expanding the company&#8217;s Gutenberg-related products. Tabor&#8217;s fellow CoBlocks founders Jeffrey Carandang and Alex Denning will not be joining GoDaddy.</p>\n<p>All the commercial themes in the ThemeBeans catalog are now available for free on <a href=\"https://github.com/godaddy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. Current customers will continue to receive theme support and remote updates until April 8, 2020. </p>\n<p>According to Aaron Campbell, GoDaddy&#8217;s head of WordPress Ecosystem &#038; Community, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/coblocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a> will continue to be freely available on WordPress.org. It currently has more than 3,000 active installations and averages a 4.7-star rating.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nothing will change with the plugin except that it will be added to the GoDaddy account on .org,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;It&#8217;s possible it might be renamed or rebranded in the future, but that&#8217;s unknown either way at this point. And yes, it will still be on the WordPress.org directory for everyone not just GoDaddy customers (and we plan to add more to it as we develop new blocks).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Campbell could not yet share a roadmap for the plugin as Tabor just started and will be heavily involved in determining the plugin&#8217;s future at GoDaddy. Tabor will also be leading a development team that is bringing on more React talent to assist with Gutenberg tasks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hiring React devs that are capable with Gutenberg is a newer thing that we&#8217;re really not totally sure whether it&#8217;ll be difficult or not or even how it&#8217;ll look,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;Do you hire WordPress people? React people? Only those that do both? Do you hire both and pair them up to learn from each other? It&#8217;s a thing we&#8217;re learning in this new post-Gutenberg world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor said he was surprised that his products had attracted GoDaddy&#8217;s interest but also found it to be validating of his own efforts and the potential of the block editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Throughout my time building themes, and then blocks, I’ve learned the real value of getting eyes on a project: Not only do you get the community rallying behind your ideas, such as the Block Manager recently added in Gutenberg 5.3, but you receive a TON of feedback and inspiration,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;Building on that feedback, consistently delivering clever ideas, and executing on the marketing front with inspiring videos, has landed us in a very opportune position.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy has acquired a handful of WordPress companies and services during the past few years (ManageWP, Sucuri, WP Curve), but Tabor&#8217;s products are the first Gutenberg-related acquisition for the company. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it means that the WordPress ecosystem is important, that it’s maturing, and probably most of all &#8211; that it’s moving and changing,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;And I think all of those are good.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg has changed a lot in WordPress. It’s not just a new editor or new interface, it’s a whole new system that brings with it a whole new group of challenges. Companies like GoDaddy recognizing this and supporting innovation is a healthy sign of growth and maturity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s resources will enable CoBlocks, ThemeBeans, and Block Gallery to move faster and add features that were previously out of reach for Tabor&#8217;s small team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ll go from just two developers, to a team of incredibly bright engineers,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;And I won’t be spending time figuring out all the intricacies of monetizing a premium plugin in today’s ever-changing WordPress ecosystem. Instead, I can focus on leading the team’s efforts on bringing a better page building experience to WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He will also have access to insights and data that will enable his team to make more informed decisions about the tools and blocks they build.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This view into how entrepreneurs and business owners are using WordPress is something I could never have achieved at a meaningful scale, and I know it will help me move more confidently in the future landscape of Gutenberg,&#8221; Tabor said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 04:15:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6874\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-beta-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3882:\"<p>WordPress 5.2 Beta 2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

That is, themes and plugins that use public widget APIs must remain functional.</li>\n<li>During a transition period, it should be possible to disable the block-based interface and return to the classic widget-editing interface.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The requirements for backwards compatibility are a tall order but will make it much easier for users to trust WordPress during this transition. Content will not be forced into the new interface and users will retain the option to use the classic widget-editing screen if they prefer. The team has not yet announced a date for when widgets will be officially deprecated. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/03/whats-new-in-gutenberg-3rd-april/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg version 5.4</a> was released last week with vertical alignment support for the columns block, a playsInline option in the video block, and a number of other minor enhancements.

When users search for a plugin that matches a term for an existing Jetpack feature, the plugin now inserts an artificial, dismissible search result into the first plugin card slot, identifying the corresponding Jetpack feature. </p>\n<p>The Jetpack team said users have a hard time knowing what features are available, with 45 modules packaged into the plugin. The idea behind the proof of concept for the suggestions was to improve the discoverability of Jetpack&#8217;s existing features. Many in the developer community became outraged after it was discovered that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-is-promoting-paid-upgrades-on-plugin-search-screen-wordpress-plugin-team-says-it-may-be-a-violation-of-directory-guidelines\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack was also advertising paid upgrades</a> in this space as well. </p>\n<p>The fact that it was rolled out with promotions for paid upgrades made it seem to many onlookers that the discoverability problem was just a pretext for injecting advertising. The WordPress Plugin Team also said it <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-is-promoting-paid-upgrades-on-plugin-search-screen-wordpress-plugin-team-says-it-may-be-a-violation-of-directory-guidelines\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">may or may not be a violation of the plugin directory guidelines</a> but that the team was still &#8220;arguing about the semantics internally.&#8221;  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2019/04/04/jetpack-7-2-1-maintenance-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Version 7.2.1</a> was released today, removing all feature suggestions that previously advertised upgrades.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We made a mistake, and we’re moving to correct it immediately,&#8221; Jetpack team representative Jesse Friedman said.  &#8220;Our intention with these feature hints is to help you discover helpful features of Jetpack that you already have, right when you need them most. Today we’re correcting an error in judgement that resulted in the hints suggesting Jetpack features that actually required an upgrade.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Characterizing the mistake as &#8220;an error in judgment&#8221; is an admission that rolling out feature suggestions with paid upgrades was a conscious decision. One month later, the Jetpack team decided it was a poor choice. This appears to have be driven by the community&#8217;s reaction, but Jetpack did not elaborate on how or why they reached the decision to revert the promotions for paid upgrades.</p>\n<h3>Jetpack 7.2.1 Updates Design for &#8220;Hints,&#8221; Plans to Adopt WordPress Core Solution in the Future</h3>\n<p>The 7.2.1 maintenance release also changes the design for the feature suggestions, which they are now referring to as &#8220;<a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/feature-hints/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feature Hints</a>.&#8221; </p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re reducing confusion around feature hints by simplifying the design and changing some text; this way it’s clear that feature hints are from Jetpack and are easily dismissible,&#8221; Friedman said.</p>\n<p>After updating to the latest release, you can see the revised design on the plugin search screen with new text: &#8220;This suggestion was made by Jetpack, the security and performance plugin already installed on your site.&#8221; Jetpack will disable the hints once administrators have dismissed three hints.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Screen-Shot-2019-04-02-at-9.30.07-AM-1.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Going forward we want to help create a feature hints solution that works for all WordPress users and plugin developers,&#8221; Friedman said. &#8220;We are excited to work with <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46763\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">suggestions like this one</a>, by Joost de Valk, and see how we might be able to find a solution in WordPress core to help users discover plugin features, and prevent this very common issue.

In a comment on an issue titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/23198\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rethinking 3.6&#8217;s Dashboard Ads</a>,&#8221; Josh Kohlbach contends that WooCommerce should limit its marketing to the plugin&#8217;s dedicated Extensions screen in the dashboard: </p>\n<blockquote><p>In addition, didn&#8217;t anyone think it might be a conflict of interest for WooCommerce the commercial entity to use WooCommerce the open source plugin to show ads in this manner? Bit anti-competitive to all the 3rd party devs out there (of which there are a lot).</p>\n<p>WooCommerce already has an amazing page under WooCommerce->Extensions with full searching capabilities etc. Why would you want to show irrelevant ads during a user&#8217;s everyday workflow?! Store owners use these screen daily, it&#8217;s terrible UX.</p>\n<p>I suggest that it gets ripped out in its entirety and filed under &#8220;cool implementation/fun to code but horrible idea for actual users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For those who do not stand to benefit from profits from the 400+ extensions on the WooCommerce.com marketplace, the intrusions in the product admins screen seem all the more offensive. Marketplace suggestions have not been well-received by third-party extension developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is in direct competition to every third-party developer that is not selling on WooCommerce’s marketplace,&#8221; Jamie Madden, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.wcvendors.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WC Vendors Marketplace</a>, said. &#8220;I am one of these. This is advertising for your commercial products, no matter how you try and wrap this. You have an extensions page already which is more than enough, but advertising your products every 24 hours is going too far. This is completely unacceptable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The general consensus of those participating in the ticket is that injecting ads into product management screens will create a disruption to store managers&#8217; workflow.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I too am very concerned about this,&#8221; digital agency owner <a href=\"https://www.bernskioldmedia.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Erik Bernskiold</a> said. &#8220;I get that WooCommerce want to benefit from their commercial side, too, and there are many ways to do this. But in this case, it feels like this is at a great disregard for the users. Hijacking a product list, order list or a user interface element in this way is a major interruption of the user experience. It&#8217;s not the place for an ad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several participants in the discussion have suggested that WooCommerce make it an opt-in toggle in the settings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is only one scenario where I think this feature should stay in place and could be beneficial: If this feature is controlled by an opt-in toggle in WC settings,&#8221; <a href=\"http://jeremypry.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy Pry</a> said. &#8220;Otherwise, this whole feature should be removed entirely. Store owners don&#8217;t need advertisements in their admin dashboard. In my opinion, leaving this feature in place would be very harmful to the WooCommerce community.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Marketplace Suggestions Require Dismissal Every Day for 5 Days, Only to Return 1 Month Later</h3>\n<p>The fact that the suggestions cannot actually be dismissed for good is one issue that developers predict will end up aggravating WooCommerce users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dismissing just to keep hounding the user, that&#8217;s not dismissing&#8230; that is snoozing,&#8221; WordPress developer <a href=\"https://mindsize.me/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick Garman</a> said. &#8220;Because I told you 5 times that I don&#8217;t want to see your ads, that doesn&#8217;t mean come back in a month. The average user shouldn&#8217;t have to use a filter to make ads go away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I would not be surprised if WooCommerce ends up dialing back the frequency of the ads after they are closed, given that nearly all those participating in the conversation consider it unacceptable to require dismissal five days in a row, with the same process repeated every month thereafter. The frequency with which they are displayed is unusually aggressive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don’t think it technically violates the guidelines it’s just obnoxious and makes WooCommerce look like a low rent solution,&#8221; Astoundify founder <a href=\"http://www.astoundify.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Pickering</a> said. &#8220;It seems we are in a midst of a monetization push and they are looking for any where they can add up sells. Apparently doing so gracefully has gone out the window.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the overwhelmingly negative feedback, WooCommerce appears to be ploughing forward on its plan to ramp up its marketing in the admin. Automattic is a business and it needs to make money with WooCommerce. Most participants in the discussion do not seem opposed to WooCommerce making money with marketplace suggestions but are strongly requesting that they do not inject ads in places where users are working on their own products in the admin. </p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing necessarily wrong with ya&#8217;ll trying to squeeze out some more money from users &#8211; so long as it&#8217;s done tastefully, and in a way that actually provides value to the user, instead of spamming and hindering them,&#8221; @justlevine <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/23198#issuecomment-479616682\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on the GitHub issue. </p>\n<p>Based on the WooCommerce developer community&#8217;s feedback, many are in agreement that they will only support changes will be respectful to store owners working in the admin. They would prefer WooCommerce focused its efforts on improving the existing Extensions tab, instead of injecting items from the marketplace on other screens. The current implementation of marketplace suggestions needs work, because it is too heavy-handed in displaying ads after users indicate through the UI that they want to dismiss them. </p>\n<p>Most participants in the discussion are in favor of letting store owners decide if they want to see ads for extensions on their product admin screens. They would prefer that users opt in through a more transparent way than simply agreeing to terms of service. At the very least, most prefer WooCommerce add a setting that would allow store owners to easily turn marketplace suggestions off. If Automattic wants this new feature to be successful, the company needs to revise the implementation to be something that doesn&#8217;t instantly make the majority of the WooCommerce developer community want to turn it off. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Apr 2019 22:55:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 350 – Don’t Touch My Plugin Search Results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88558&preview=true&preview_id=88558\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-350-dont-touch-my-plugin-search-results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1895:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss a controversial feature in Jetpack 7.1 that adds feature suggestions to plugin search results.

I spoke a bit about this kind of thing at WordCamp US last year, but if you don&#8217;t feel like sitting through a half hour video, let me summarise my thoughts. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I agree that React is hard. I <em>strongly</em> disagree with the commonly contrasted view that HTML, CSS, PHP, or vanilla JavaScript are easy. They&#8217;re all just as hard to work with as React, sometimes more-so, particularly when having to deal with the exciting world of cross-browser compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage that PHP has over modern JavaScript development isn&#8217;t that it&#8217;s easy, or that the tooling is better, or more reliable, or anything like that. The advantage is that it&#8217;s familiar. If you&#8217;re new to web development, React is just as easy anything else to start with.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Something I’m seeing a lot.<br /><br />Beginners: This makes sense, we understand it.<br /><br />Experienced developers: There’s no way beginners would understand it. It’s not like &lt;a thing I learned ten years ago&gt;.</p>&mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1096784072943300608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2019</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m honestly shocked when someone manages to wade through the mess of tooling (even pre-Gutenberg) to contribute to WordPress. It&#8217;s such an incomprehensible, thankless, unreliable process, the tenacity of anyone who makes it out the other side should be applauded. That said, this high barrier is unacceptable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working in this industry for long enough to have forgotten the number of iterations of my personal development environment I&#8217;ve gone through, to get to where I can set up something for myself which <em>isn&#8217;t awful</em>. React wasn&#8217;t around for all of that time, so that can&#8217;t be the reason web development has been hard for as long as I remember. What is, then?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Doing Better</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past year or so, I&#8217;ve been tinkering with a tool to help deal with the difficulties of contributing to WordPress. That tool is called <a href=\"https://github.com/pento/testpress/\">TestPress</a>, it&#8217;s getting pretty close to being usable, at least on MacOS. Windows support is a little less reliable, but getting better. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> If you enjoy tinkering with tools, too, you&#8217;re welcome to try out the development version, but it does still has some bugs in it. Feedback and PRs are always welcome! There are some screenshots in <a href=\"https://github.com/pento/testpress/issues/114\">this issue</a> that give an idea of what the experience is like, if you&#8217;d like to check it out that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TestPress is not a panacea: at best, it&#8217;s an attempt at levelling the playing field a little bit. You shouldn&#8217;t need years of experience to build a reliable development environment, that should be the bare minimum we provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>React is part of the solution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s still a lot of work to do to make web development something that anyone can easily get into. I think React is part of the solution to this, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>React isn&#8217;t without its problems, of course. Modern JavaScript can encourage iteration for the sake of iteration. Certainly, there&#8217;s a drive to React-ify All The Things (a trap I&#8217;m guilty of falling into, as well). React&#8217;s development model is fundamentally different to that of vanilla JavaScript or jQuery, which is why it can seem incomprehensible if you&#8217;re already well versed in the old way of doing things: it requires a shift in your mental model of how JavaScript works. This is a hard problem to solve, but it&#8217;s not insurmountable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps a little controversially, I <em>don&#8217;t</em> think that React is guilty of causing the web to become less accessible. At worst, it&#8217;s continuing the long standing practice of web standards making accessibility an optional extra. Building anything beyond a basic, non-interactive web page with just HTML and CSS will inevitably cause accessibility issues, unless you happen to be familiar with the mystical combinations of accessible tags, or applying aria attributes, or styling your content in just the right way (and none of the wrong ways).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>React (or any component-based development system, really) can improve accessibility for everyone, and we&#8217;re seeing this with Gutenberg already. By providing a set of base components for plugin and theme authors to use, we can ensure the correct HTML is produced for screen readers to work with. Much like desktop and mobile app developers don&#8217;t need to do anything to make their apps accessible (because it&#8217;s baked into the APIs they use to build their apps), web developers should have the same experience, regardless of the complexity of the app they&#8217;re building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguing that accessibility needs to be part of the design process is the wrong argument. Accessibility shouldn&#8217;t be a consideration, it should be unavoidable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do Better</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, can we do better? Absolutely. There&#8217;s always room for improvement. People shouldn&#8217;t need to learn React if they don&#8217;t want to. They shouldn&#8217;t have to deal with the complexities of the WCAG. They should have the freedom to tinker, and the reassurance that they can tinker without breaking everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pre-React web didn&#8217;t arrive in its final form, all clean, shiny, and perfect. It took decades of evolution to get there. The post-React web needs some time to evolve, too, but it has the benefit of hindsight: we can compress the decades of evolving into a much shorter time period, provide a fresh start for those who want it, while also providing backwards compatibility with the existing ways of doing things.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Apr 2019 06:31:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Gary\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:148:\"WPTavern: Jetpack Is Promoting Paid Upgrades on Plugin Search Screen, WordPress Plugin Team Says it “May be a Violation” of Directory Guidelines\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88485\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:152:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-is-promoting-paid-upgrades-on-plugin-search-screen-wordpress-plugin-team-says-it-may-be-a-violation-of-directory-guidelines\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8991:\"<p>Yesterday the discussion surrounding <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-7-1-adds-feature-suggestions-to-plugin-search-results\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack&#8217;s implementation of feature suggestions in the plugin search screen</a> became heated after developers pointed out that Automattic is also using these suggestions to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-7-1-adds-feature-suggestions-to-plugin-search-results#comment-284507\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">promote paid upgrades</a>. You can test this by searching for &#8220;backups&#8221; where you find that Jetpack&#8217;s commercial offering takes the place of the first result, pushing all other results further down one slot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jetpack-advertising-paid-upgrades.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The feature suggestions were added in versions 7.1 to inform users of an existing feature in Jetpack when they search for something similar. The Jetpack team said they developed it to solve a discovery problem, where users are quite often not familiar with all of Jetpack&#8217;s 45 modules and end up installing plugins to perform functionality that Jetpack already includes. A PR in the Jetpack repository has been merged to <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/11876\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">only show feature suggestions when the user&#8217;s plan supports it</a>, so it looks like these promotions for commercial features will be removed in a future release of the plugin. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether Automattic intentionally rolled out the feature suggestions in its current form (with paid upgrades included) to test the waters and gauge the community&#8217;s reaction, or if it is simply a mistake. The PR was marked as an enhancement, not a bug. </p>\n<p>According to Plugin Team member Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood, feature suggestions with paid upgrades included is &#8220;likely a violation&#8221; of the plugin directory&#8217;s guidelines.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Promoting other plugins or premium upgrades in the same space would likely not be allowed, because it would be misleading or an incorrect place to put &#8216;advertising,&#8217; Wood said. &#8220;Guidelines already say not to do that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I contacted the Plugin Team today and it seems the topic of feature suggestions on the plugin screen are still a matter of ongoing debate. The team would not officially confirm whether or not Jetpack is currently in violation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t confirm that at this time,&#8221; Mika Epstein said. &#8220;It might be a violation, but it also may not be. Much of that comes down to intent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A case can be made that they&#8217;re promoting paid services for existing features, and is that different from an image-optimizer plugin promoting it&#8217;s own service which you&#8217;re already using? It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re promoting separate plugins, so it&#8217;s in a very odd grey area for services.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Epstein said the team is &#8220;still arguing the semantics internally about that one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many people have asked why Jetpack has not been removed from the plugin directory for advertising its commercial offerings on the plugin screen. The Plugin Team&#8217;s official response is that if Jetpack is in violation, they reserve the right to make an exception and opt not to close it. Epstein, on behalf of the team, offered the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It falls under our <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/#18-we-reserve-the-right-to-maintain-the-plugin-directory-to-the-best-of-our-ability\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">18th guideline</a>:</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to NOT close a plugin and grant exceptions.</p>\n<p>Closing plugins is ALWAYS a tricky thing. We regularly warn, and do not close, larger plugins as closing them would have an adverse impact on the entire WordPress community. Closing plugins with 500,000 users can be more harmful than helpful, even when there are security problems. The more users a plugin gets, the more difficult it is to weigh the risks of closing versus not closing.</p>\n<p>Maintaining the trust in larger plugins is as important as doing so with the directory as a whole. With so many outlets wanting to spin up FUD and blast outrage at everyone involved as their first reaction, we try to stem the tide a little and not act like the sky is falling all the time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jetpack has more than 5 million active installs. If it is found to be in violation of the guidelines, it is not likely to be removed due to the impact it would have on millions of WordPress users, not to mention the hosts who have it pre-installed on WordPress hosting plans. </p>\n<p>The discussion regarding how WordPress can improve the implementation of feature suggestions on the plugin screen for all plugins is happening in a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46763\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> on trac opened by Joost de Valk. This ticket does not debate whether or not feature suggestions are a good idea in general but rather focuses on how results can better communicate that a feature is already active or available. de Valk shared a screenshot of what the screen currently looks like when a user searches for a plugin for which they already have a match installed:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/active-plugin.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The disabled &#8216;Active&#8217; button there is not very useful, as it doesn&#8217;t provide any context as to why that button is disabled,&#8221; de Valk said. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to propose a change: let&#8217;s turn this into two separate groups of results, one that says &#8216;these plugins you already have installed might be able to help&#8217; and then a second group below that with other plugins.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tim Hengeveld posted a mockup of what an implementation of that might look like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mockup-plugin-screen.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The topic of feature suggestions on this screen is still highly controversial, despite the Plugin Team confirming that it is not breaking the guidelines (as long as plugins don&#8217;t promote paid upgrades). Plugin authors have worked for years towards better rankings on this screen by providing quality support and updates that translate into better ratings and more installs. Any mega plugin that offers multiple modules packed into one can easily usurp these rankings by suggesting its own features and having them automatically appear in that top slot. These features could even be broken down into multiple micro-modules so that there is always something to suggest. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I make a bit of side income off of <a href=\"https://t.co/aqHIydpjrL\">https://t.co/aqHIydpjrL</a> </p>\n<p>ALL folks who purchase come from free users of my WordPress(dot)org-hosted plugin. </p>\n<p>After years of hard work, it shows up first in the list when you search for the word \"Tweet.\" </p>\n<p>Unless you have Jetpack installed. <a href=\"https://t.co/9stTJ4TJre\">pic.twitter.com/9stTJ4TJre</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Ben Meredith-speaking at #WCRaleigh (@benUNC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benUNC/status/1113277858540077056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 3, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Because it’s Jetpack and they’ve created this precedence with blessings from .org, it’ll be interesting to see if and how many plugin providers are going to pivot towards Jetpack’s business model of a branded ‘suite’ instead of maintaining separate plugins for separate concerns.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Caspar<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f337.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />Hübinger (@glueckpress) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/glueckpress/status/1113328574050787328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 3, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many in the WordPress development community are worried that plugin authors will move towards distributing their work as large suites of modules in order to take advantage of promoting their own features in the plugin search screen.

Michael Waterfall, iOS Engineer at ASOS, tested the &#8220;kill switch&#8221; function and demonstrated that it still works with prior versions.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It also confirms they lied. They _still_ have the ability to wipe any blog that hasn\'t updated to the new plugin version (4.8.0), which they hurriedly released to delete the kill switch after they were exposed the other day. <a href=\"https://t.co/bNMfRQUBpr\">pic.twitter.com/bNMfRQUBpr</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Michael Waterfall (@mwaterfall) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mwaterfall/status/1112445109755359233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 31, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Veenstra&#8217;s investigation also uncovered questionable remote calls in the plugin&#8217;s cron events, undisclosed content and configuration rewrites, and a list of popular plugins that are immediately deactivated when P3 is activated, without the user&#8217;s knowledge. He found that some of these plugins are deactivated alongside admin_init, so any user attempts to reactivate the plugins will not stick.</p>\n<p>Wordfence estimates the P3 plugin to have an install base of 10,000-15,000 sites. The changes made in version 4.8.0 of the plugin are not transparently identified in the changelog, so it&#8217;s not easy for users to know what has changed. The content filtering and the plugin deactivations remain in the most recent release. These types of veiled functions performed without permission could have unintended consequences on sites using the plugin, which non-technical users may not be able to fix themselves.</p>\n<h3>Pipdig P3 Plugin Performed a DDoS Attack on a Competitor&#8217;s Site</h3>\n<p>Jem Turner, a freelance web developer based in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/2019/security-alert-pipdig-insecure-ddosing-competitors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published a lengthy analysis of the P3 plugin</a> the same day that Wordfence released its analysis. She drilled down further into the remote requests, demonstrating how Pipdig has been using the P3 plugin to perform a DDoS attack on a competitor who also provides WordPress themes and installation services to bloggers. The code triggers an hourly cron job on users&#8217; sites, effectively using their customers&#8217; servers to send malicious requests to the competitor&#8217;s site.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The code comment tells us this is “checking the CDN (content delivery network) cache”. It’s not. This is performing a GET request on a file (id39dqm3c0_license_h.txt) sat on pipdigz.co.uk, which yesterday morning returned ‘https://kotrynabassdesign.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php’ in the response body.</p>\n<p>Every single hour night and day, without any manual intervention, any blogger running the pipdig plugin will send a request with a faked User Agent to ‘https://kotrynabassdesign.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php’ with a random number string attached. This is effectively performing a small scale DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) on kotrynabassdesign.com’s server.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Turner also contacted <a href=\"http://kotrynabassdesign.com’\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kotryna Bass</a>, Pipdig&#8217;s competitor, who said she had contacted her host after finding that her admin-ajax.php file was under some kind of attack. Bass&#8217; exchanges with her host are also published in Turner&#8217;s report.</p>\n<p>Turner&#8217;s post explained how Pipdig&#8217;s P3 plugin code manipulated links to point to their own products and services when a user includes a link to a competitor in the the content:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Here we have pipdig’s plugin searching for mentions of ‘blogerize.com‘ with the string split in two and rejoined – concatenated – to make it harder to find mentions of competitors when doing a mass ‘Find in Files’ across the plugin (amongst other things). When the plugin finds links to blogerize.com in blogger’s content (posts, pages), they’re swapped out with a link to ‘pipdig.co/shop/blogger-to-wordpress-migration/’ i.e. pipdig’s own blog migration services. Swapping these links out boost the SEO benefit to pipdig, and the vast majority of bloggers wouldn’t notice the switcheroo (especially as if the page/post was edited, the link to blogerize would appear in the backend as normal).</p></blockquote>\n<p>The plugin did not ask users&#8217; permission before performing any of these actions and most of them were implemented with obfuscated code. Turner&#8217;s investigation also covers how the P3 plugin could harvest data and change admin passwords. Many of the findings overlap with Wordfence&#8217;s analysis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was aware that Wordfence had been contacted for an opinion, although I was unaware they were writing a post and vice versa,&#8221; Turner said. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t surprised that they wrote about it though, given the risk to WordPress users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She has been in contact with authorities regarding Pipdig&#8217;s unethical coding practices and privacy violations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From my side of things, I&#8217;ve been in contact with Action Fraud (submitted a report through their website) and NCSC (who pointed me back to Action Fraud and gave me a number to call). From pipdig&#8217;s side, there are threats of legal action in their blog post but I&#8217;ve received nothing yet.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Pipdig&#8217;s Public Response Skirts Critical Concerns</h3>\n<p>Pipdig Creative Director Phil Clothier <a href=\"https://www.pipdig.co/blog/sad-times/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published a public response</a> from the company which opens by characterizing the recent investigations as &#8220;various accusations and rumours spreading about pipdig&#8221; and includes an emotional plea regarding how  distressing recent developments have been for his company. He claims that his team and their supporters are being harassed. </p>\n<p>After pushing out the 4.8.0 version of the P3 plugin, removing some but not all of the offensive code, Clothier opts for a Q&#038;A style format for his post, putting every question in the present tense:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Do you DDOS competitors?<br />\nNo.</p>\n<p>Do you “kill” sites?<br />\nNo!</p>\n<p>Do you have the ability to kill sites via the pipdig Power Pack?<br />\nNo</p></blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the &#8220;kill switch&#8221; feature they built in, which detects all tables with the WordPress prefix and drops each of them, Clothier said it was simply a function to reset a site back to its default settings. He deliberately misrepresented what it does: </p>\n<blockquote><p>There was function in an older version of the plugin which could be used to reset a site back to the default settings. This function had no risk of of malicious or unintentional use. I can say categorically that there was no risk to your site if you were using a pipdig theme. This feature has been dug up and labelled a “Kill Switch” for maximum negative impact on us.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Clothier claims the function was available in the P3 plugin in July 2018 when a third party started posting Pipdig themes for sale on their own site:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A 3rd party was able to download all of our themes illegitimately and post them on a clone of our own site. This included previews of our themes and the ability to purchase them. We were first alerted to this by people which had purchased a pipdig theme from there, but were finding that certain features did not work correctly. After investigation, we found that the victim had purchased the theme from the 3rd party, thinking it was us. The 3rd party not only gained the financial benefit of the theme payment, but also used it as a way to inject malware and ads into the victim’s site. The reset function was put in place in order to remove the 3rd party’s ability to host preview sites with our themes. It worked, and they have since disappeared. The function was then removed in a later version of the plugin.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a false claim, as Wordfence pointed out in an updated <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/04/pipdig-update-dishonest-denials-erased-evidence-and-ongoing-offenses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>. The first instance of the code responsible for database deletion was <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190331195426/https://bitbucket.org/pipdig/p3/commits/edc47824200e15d64cab7270debc4a0526a8d323\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">committed to the plugin in November 2017</a>. </p>\n<p>The company failed to address the most critical concerns presented in the Wordfence analysis in its first pass at issuing a public statement. Instead, on the matter of coordinating a DDoS attack on competitors, Pipdig blames users and suggests they may have added the competitor&#8217;s URL to their sites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re now looking into why this function is returning this url,&#8221; Clothier said. &#8220;However, it seems to suggest that some of the &#8216;Author URLs&#8217; have been set to ‘kotrynabassdesign.com’. We don’t currently know why this is the case, or whether the site owner has intentionally changed this.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/04/pipdig-update-dishonest-denials-erased-evidence-and-ongoing-offenses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Further investigations</a> published by Wordfence today showed that Pipdig also added DDoS code to its Blogger templates and was actively issuing malicious requests up until yesterday:</p>\n<blockquote><p>During the investigation of Pipdig’s WordPress plugin and themes, we also came across some curious code associated with their Blogger themes. This code is part of Pipdig’s suspected DDoS campaign against their competitor, and was active until April 1, four days after Pipdig’s denial of any such behavior.</p>\n<p>Some of Pipdig’s Blogger themes have been confirmed to make external JavaScript calls to Pipdig’s server, specifically to the script hXXps://pipdigz[.]co[.]uk/js/zeplin1.js.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On March 31, as the investigations became public, Pipdig deleted its public Bitbucket repository and replaced it with a &#8220;clean one,&#8221; removing three years of commit history. Wordfence and many others cloned the repository before it was deleted and saved snapshots of pages to cite in the investigation.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That clean repository <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pipdig?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@pipdig</a> published earlier today in place of the one containing all of their malicious code&#8230; They changed the reported release date of version 4.8.0. <a href=\"https://t.co/YqKASTUZE7\">pic.twitter.com/YqKASTUZE7</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Nicky Bloor (@nickstadb) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickstadb/status/1112796890855325697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pipdig&#8217;s public statement contains a number of other false claims that are outlined in Wordfence&#8217;s followup piece with code examples. Clothier closes the article by casting aspersion on the press, presumably to encourage customers not to trust what they read from other sources.</p>\n<p>I contacted Pipdig for their comment on recent events, but Clothier declined to answer any of my questions. One of those was why the plugin disables Bluehost&#8217;s caching plugin without informing customers. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Another one from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pipdig?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@pipdig</a> plugin.

However we also contend that the previous versions had no serious issues too.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pipdig declined to answer questions about licensing but the products <a href=\"https://support.pipdig.co/license/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">do not appear to be GPL-licensed</a>. This may be why the company deemed it within its rights to take action on those who they believe to have &#8220;stolen&#8221; their themes.  </p>\n<h3>Pipdig Customers Share Mixed Reactions to Reports of Vendor Backdoors and DDoS Attacks</h3>\n<p>In what is perhaps one of the most brazen abuses I&#8217;ve ever seen from a theme company in WordPress&#8217; history, Pipdig&#8217;s user base has unknowingly been used to target the company&#8217;s competitors. Regardless of the company&#8217;s motive in combatting the unauthorized distribution of their themes, these types of backdoors and undisclosed content rewrites are indefensible. They prey upon user trust and in this case the victims were primarily bloggers.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I think that\'s why so many of us are so angry.

If you are a Pipdig customer affected by this incident, there is no assurance that the company will not build more backdoors into your site in the future. The plugin updates are not reviewed by any kind of authority. Fortunately, there are a few actions you can take to create a safer environment for your website. </p>\n<p>First, look for <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/wordpress-licensing-the-gpl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GPL-licensed themes and plugins</a>, because they grant you more freedoms as the user and are compatible with WordPress&#8217; legal license.

Thinking of it, I found it to be one of the most fortunate things I had in my career and life. I can do what I love, can make money to support myself, my family and have many good friends.</p>\n<p>When I found out about WordPress, I was still a second-year student at the university. The major I studied was not IT but mechanical engineering. I chose it with the desire to get a scholarship abroad (it was in Russia). But in the process of learning, I found myself inclined to and more passionate about coding. Therefore, I taught myself coding.</p>\n<p>In my second year of university, I wanted to set up a website to download software. It is not a very proud thing, because at that time I just wanted to share the software with everyone, including free software and pirated software (software pirating is still a big problem in Russia and in Vietnam). It can be said that software was what attracted me the most at that time. I was passionate about finding new software, testing, running them, finding great features and sharing experiences with people.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At that time, the web was still something very new to me and I didn’t have many concepts about it. I just needed to find a free platform to build a blog about software.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At that time, there were two platforms that caught my attention &#8211; WordPress and BoBlog. BoBlog was a Chinese platform (it’s dead now), and WordPress seemed more international, so I chose WordPress.</p>\n<p>It can be said that the choice of WordPress has made me learn more seriously about the web and related technologies. By editing the theme, making additional features for my blog, I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. During my time at the university, I had been exploring these things and gradually improving my knowledge base.</p>\n<p>For me, the web has a big advantage comparing to other software, which is any line of code you write, you can see the result right in the browser by just pressing F5. This was the point that I was very excited about because when I tried coding in other languages, the compiling process made me feel time-consuming and not very intuitive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Start_My_Own_Blog_10\">Start My Own Blog</h3>\n<p>After that, I felt that the knowledge I learned was quite interesting and wanted to share it with everyone. So I started my personal blog, it is still active at <a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/deluxeblogtips.com\">deluxeblogtips.com</a>. Blogging is an important thing in my career, maybe the most. It brings a lot of fortunate to me:</p>\n<p><strong>English:</strong> English is not my native language. But by blogging, my reading and communication skill in English has improved significantly. Although there are still many errors, I feel quite confident when talking to international friends. This has been happening for a long time and I am very grateful for it.</p>\n<p><strong>The first freelance jobs:</strong> Blogging has been around for a while, some people knew about me thanks to my helpful sharing. And they started contacting me and asked if I wanted to work for them. At that time, as a student, I was very happy, because I could earn some money. Later, when I graduated from university, I started my career with those freelance jobs. I did freelancing for about 4-5 years since 2010. I participated in many projects, learned a lot of things and knew a lot of friends. During this time, I also gathered a group of Vietnamese friends to work on those freelance jobs. Until now, although the group is no longer available, we are still good friends and still meet often.</p>\n<p><strong>Start ideas for products:</strong> precisely <a href=\"https://metabox.io\">Meta Box</a>. This is my company’s flagship product at the moment. Its idea started from my tutorial on the blog. Thanks to those sharing, it’s now a plugin of 400,000 active installs that based on a tutorial.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Community_20\">Community</h3>\n<p>Blogging makes many people known about me. And my share (and other products) is also useful for many people and thanks to that, I connect with many developers around the world and in Vietnam. In 2012, when Philip Author Moore came to Vietnam, we met the first time, and it was a “fateful” meeting between us. Together, we built the WordPress community in Vietnam from those early years, started the Hanoi WordPress Meetup and shared a lot of things about WordPress. There were many companies in Vietnam starting to redirect and working on WordPress from such meetup sessions.</p>\n<p>So far, the community has been strong and we are no longer involved because we’re quite busy and we do not have too much experience in organizing and maintaining offline activities. Online activities are still very exciting thanks to Facebook!</p>\n<h3 id=\"Building_products_and_company_26\">Building products and company</h3>\n<p>Being a developer and having the opportunity to work on projects with customers, in 2010, I found many things missing from WordPress. And at that time, I had the idea of <a href=\"https://metabox.io\">Meta Box</a>, which is a developer framework to quickly create custom fields. I shared a series of tutorials on my blog. What I didn’t expect was that there were so many people having the same interest.</p>\n<p>After that, I continuously upgraded the plugin, based on feedback from other users and developers. I also get a lot of help from other developers, especially <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/unserkaiser\">Kaiser</a>. I am really grateful to them because, without them, Meta Box could not become a plugin with 400,000 active installs.</p>\n<p>When I first developed the plugin, I didn’t have much idea about commercializing it. All were free. At that time, I didn’t know much about interacting on <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">wordpress.org</a> and the Trac system, so I released the code on Google Code. A long time later, I uploaded it to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/\">wordpress.org</a>. Therefore, when comparing the custom fields plugins, Meta Box is sometimes not considered the first plugin, while it should be.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The idea of Meta Box was later inherited by many people and developed similar plugins. And I really like that, because that’s the idea of open source!</p></blockquote>\n<p>The success of Meta Box was the basis for me to establish my own company &#8211; <a href=\"https://elightup.com\">eLightUp</a> to develop products for WordPress.</p>\n<p>In addition to Meta Box, while creating a freelance team, we also tried to become a theme provider and joined ThemeForest. It was not very successful, because I feel ThemeForest is a battlefield in which the parties race to add features to make a theme become powerful, able to do many things and therefore very bloated and not optimal. As a developer, I always feel uncomfortable with those things.</p>\n<p>The theme work then was separated into two brands of our company: <a href=\"https://fitwp.com\">FitWP</a> for themes on ThemeForest and <a href=\"https://gretathemes.com\">GretaThemes</a> for themes that are simple, optimal and serve a specific purpose. Currently, the focus of our company are Meta Box and GretaThemes.</p>\n<p>And for freelance work, we moved into a division of our company that specializes in <a href=\"https://elightup.com/projects/\">projects with customers</a>. We carry out projects for both domestic and international customers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The_shift_in_roles_44\">The shift in roles</h3>\n<p>Before establishing the company, the income from the products and projects helped me and my family have a comfortable life in Vietnam. But for a long time in the WordPress community, I’ve seen many brands that I’ve always admired, especially WooThemes (now merged into Automattic). Seeing their great contributions to the community, I always want to do the same. And to do that, it’s difficult to do as an individual. So I founded <a href=\"https://elightup.com\">eLightUp</a>, wishing to create good products and contribute to the community.</p>\n<p>When I founded the company, I did not measure all the management issues or predicted that. I had to learn a lot, from managing people, resources, finance to strategy, market research and marketing. As a developer, they are all new and challenging things. There were times when I was very stressful because I had to do both developing products and other work which were not my strength.</p>\n<p>So far, things have gotten better, I have become more comfortable to work, although I still have to code and manage at the same time.</p>\n<p>Above all, I see what I have now is big luck, and that is totally love and support from the community for me. Therefore, no matter how difficult or challenging things are, I still feel very happy with what I have and will try to do better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vietnamese\">Tiếng Việt</h2>\n<p>Đã 13 năm kể từ khi tôi biết đến WordPress lần đầu tiên. Nghĩ lại, tôi thấy đó là một trong những điều may mắn nhất mà tôi có được trong sự nghiệp và cuộc sống của mình. Tôi được làm điều mà tôi yêu thích, có thể kiếm tiền nuôi sống được bản thân, gia đình và có thêm nhiều bạn bè tốt.</p>\n<p>Khi tôi biết đến WordPress, tôi vẫn còn là 1 cậu sinh viên năm thứ 2. Chuyên ngành mà tôi học không phải là IT mà là cơ khí chế tạo máy. Tôi đã chọn chuyên ngành đó với mong muốn có được 1 suất học bổng ở nước ngoài, khi đó là ở Nga. Nhưng trong quá trình học tập, tôi thấy mình có thiên hướng và đam mê về lập trình nhiều hơn. Vì thế, tôi đã tự học và bổ sung các kiến thức về IT cho mình.</p>\n<p>Năm thứ 2 đại học, tôi muốn lập 1 website về download phần mềm. Cũng không phải là một điều tự hào gì lắm, vì lúc đó tôi chỉ muốn chia sẻ các phần mềm với mọi người, trong đó có phần mềm miễn phí và có cả phần mềm crack (vấn nạn crack phần mềm ở Nga và ở Việt Nam vẫn còn rất lớn). Có thể nói phần mềm là thứ thu hút tôi lúc đó nhiều nhất. Tôi say mê tìm phần mềm mới, thử nghiệm, chạy chúng, tìm các tính năng hay và chia sẻ kinh nghiệm với mọi người. Lúc đó, web vẫn còn là một thứ gì đó rất thô sơ và tôi cũng chưa có nhiều khái niệm về nó. Tôi loay hoay tìm một nền tảng có sẵn để xây dựng một blog về phần mềm. Vào thời điểm đó, có 2 nền tảng đã gây sự chú ý với tôi &#8211; đó là WordPress và BoBlog. BoBlog là 1 blog của Trung Quốc, còn WordPress thì có vẻ quốc tế hơn, nên tôi đã chọn WordPress.</p>\n<p>Có thể nói sự lựa chọn WordPress đã khiến tôi học hỏi nghiêm túc hơn về web và các công nghệ liên quan. Bằng cách chỉnh sửa giao diện, làm thêm các tính năng bổ sung cho blog của mình mà tôi đã học được nhiều điều về HTML, CSS, JavaScript và PHP. Trong suốt thời gian học đại học, tôi đã mày mò những cái này và dần hoàn thiện nền tảng kiến thức của mình.</p>\n<p>Đối với tôi, web có 1 điểm hơn các phần mềm khác, đó là bất kỳ dòng code nào mà bạn viết, bạn có thể thấy kết quả của nó ngay trên trình duyệt (chỉ với 1 lần nhấn F5). Đây là điểm mà tôi rất thích thú, vì trước đó tôi đã thử lập trình trên một số ngôn ngữ khác, nhưng quá trình biên dịch khiến tôi cảm thấy mất thời gian và không trực quan lắm.</p>\n<h3>Bắt đầu viết blog</h3>\n<p>Sau đó, tôi cảm thấy những kiến thức mà tôi học hỏi được cũng khá thú vị và muốn chia sẻ nó với mọi người. Và tôi bắt đầu viết blog để chia sẻ. Blog của tôi đến nay vẫn hoạt động tại <a href=\"http://deluxeblogtips.com\">deluxeblogtips.com</a>. Có thể nói viết blog là bước ngoặt quan trọng trong sự nghiệp của tôi. Nó đã giúp tôi có được nhiều thứ quyết định trong sự nghiệp của mình:</p>\n<p><strong>Tiếng Anh:</strong> tiếng Anh vốn không phải là ngôn ngữ mẹ đẻ của tôi. Nhưng nhờ trau dồi viết blog mà khả năng đọc hiểu và trao đổi bằng tiếng Anh của tôi tiến bộ rõ rệt. Mặc dù còn nhiều lỗi, nhưng tôi cảm thấy khá tự tin khi nói chuyện với bạn bè quốc tế. Việc này xảy ra trong khoảng thời gian dài và tôi rất biết ơn điều đó.</p>\n<p><strong>Những công việc freelance đầu tiên:</strong> Viết blog được 1 khoảng thời gian, nhờ những chia sẻ có ích của mình mà một số người đã biết đến tôi. Và họ bắt đầu contact với tôi và hỏi xem tôi có muốn làm việc cho họ không. Lúc đó, với 1 sinh viên thì tôi rất vui mừng, vì có thể kiếm được chút ít tiền. Về sau này, khi tôi tốt nghiệp đại học, tôi đã bắt đầu sự nghiệp của mình bằng những công việc freelance đó. Tôi đã làm freelance trong suốt khoảng 4-5 năm kể từ 2010. Tôi đã được tham gia nhiều dự án, học hỏi được rất nhiều điều và biết được thêm rất nhiều bạn bè. Trong khoảng thời gian này, tôi cũng đã tập hợp được 1 số bạn bè cùng làm WordPress tại Việt Nam thành 1 nhóm và cùng làm các công việc freelance đó. Đến nay, tuy nhóm cũ không còn, nhưng chúng tôi vẫn là những người bạn tốt và vẫn hay thường xuyên gặp nhau.</p>\n<p><strong>Bắt đầu ý tưởng cho các sản phẩm:</strong> cụ thể là <a href=\"https://metabox.io\">Meta Box</a>. Đây là sản phẩm flagship của công ty của tôi hiện tại. Ý tưởng của nó bắt nguồn từ những chia sẻ của tôi trên blog. Nhờ những chia sẻ đó mà tôi đã xây dựng 1 sản phẩm được 400.000 người sử dụng với gốc là từ 1 bài tutorial.</p>\n<h3>Cộng đồng</h3>\n<p>Viết blog khiến nhiều người biết đến tôi. Và những chia sẻ của tôi (và cả các sản phẩm nữa) cũng có ích cho nhiều người và nhờ đó tôi cũng kết nối được với nhiều bạn developer trên thế giới và ở Việt Nam. Năm 2012, khi anh Philip Author Moore tới Việt Nam, chúng tôi đã gặp nhau lần đầu tiên, và đó là buổi gặp “định mệnh” giữa chúng tôi. Cả 2 chúng tôi đã xây dựng cộng đồng WordPress Việt Nam từ những năm đầu đó, cùng start Hanoi WordPress meetup và chia sẻ rất nhiều điều về WordPress. Có rất nhiều công ty ở Việt Nam bắt đầu chuyển hướng và làm về WordPress từ những buổi meetup như vậy.</p>\n<p>Đến nay, cộng đồng đã vững mạnh và chúng tôi không còn tham gia nhiều nữa vì công việc khá bận rộn và bản thân chúng tôi cũng không có quá nhiều kinh nghiệm trong việc tổ chức và duy trì các hoạt động offline. Các hoạt động online thì vẫn diễn ra rất sôi động nhờ vào Facebook!</p>\n<h3>Xây dựng sản phẩm và công ty</h3>\n<p>Vốn là 1 developer và đã có cơ hội làm việc với các dự án với khách hàng, vào những năm 2010, tôi thấy có nhiều điều còn thiếu trong WordPress. Và lúc đó, tôi đã có ý tưởng về <a href=\"https://metabox.io\">Meta Box</a>, là một framework giúp developer tạo nhanh các custom fields. Tôi đã chia sẻ 1 loạt bài tutorial về việc xây dựng nó trên blog của mình. Và điều tôi không ngờ lúc đó là có rất nhiều người có cùng mối quan tâm như vậy.</p>\n<p>Sau đó, tôi đã liên tục nâng cấp plugin, dựa theo những phản hồi của các developer khác. Tôi cũng nhận được sự giúp đỡ rất nhiều của các bạn developer khác, mà trong đó không thể không nhắc tới <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/unserkaiser\">Kaiser</a>. Tôi thực sự rất biết ơn các bạn, cả những người dùng nữa, vì không có các bạn thì Meta Box đã không thể trở thành 1 plugin với 400.000 lượt active installs được.</p>\n<p>Khi mới phát triển plugin, tôi chưa có ý niệm nhiều về thương mại hoá nó. Toàn bộ đều được chia sẻ miễn phí. Lúc đó, tôi cũng chưa biết nhiều về tương tác trên <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">wordpress.org</a> với hệ thống Trac, nên tôi release code trên Google Code. Mãi sau này tôi mới đưa lên <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">wordpress.org</a>. Vì thế nên nhiều khi so sánh tuổi đời của các plugin về custom fields, Meta Box đôi khi không được coi là plugin đầu tiên, trong khi đúng ra là nó phải là như vậy.</p>\n<p>Ý tưởng của Meta Box sau này còn được nhiều người kế thừa và phát triển ra các plugin tương tự. Và tôi rất thích điều đó, vì đó là tư tưởng của open source!</p>\n<p>Sự thành công của Meta Box là cơ sở để tôi thành lập công ty của riêng mình &#8211; <a href=\"https://elightup.com\">eLightUp</a> để phát triển các sản phẩm cho WordPress.</p>\n<p>Ngoài Meta Box, trong khi thành lập nhóm làm freelance, chúng tôi cũng đã thử dấn thân vào mảng làm theme và đã tham gia ThemeForest. Có thể nói là mảng đó không được thành công lắm, vì tôi cảm thấy ThemeForest là một chiến trường trong đó các bên đua nhau thêm những tính năng để cho 1 theme trở nên mạnh mẽ, làm được nhiều thứ và do đó rất nặng nề và không tối ưu. Mà tôi là 1 developer nên luôn cảm thấy không thoải mái với những điều đó.</p>\n<p>Mảng làm theme sau này phân tách ra thành 2 brands của công ty chúng tôi: <a href=\"https://fitwp.com\">FitWP</a> cho những theme trên ThemeForest và <a href=\"https://gretathemes.com\">GretaThemes</a> cho những theme đơn giản, tối ưu và phục vụ 1 mục đích cụ thể. Hiện nay thì trọng tâm của công ty chúng tôi là Meta Box và GretaThemes.</p>\n<p>Còn mảng làm freelance sau này chúng tôi tách thành một nhánh trong công ty của chúng tôi là chuyên làm các <a href=\"https://elightup.com/projects/\">dự án với khách hàng</a>. Chúng tôi thực hiện các dự án cho cả khách hàng trong nước và quốc tế.</p>\n<h3>Sự chuyển dịch vai trò</h3>\n<p>Trước khi thành lập công ty, nguồn thu nhập mà các sản phẩm và dự án mang lại cũng đã giúp tôi và gia đình có 1 cuộc sống khá thoải mái ở Việt Nam. Nhưng ở trong cộng đồng WordPress đã lâu, tôi đã thấy rất nhiều brand mà khiến tôi luôn ngưỡng mộ, trong đó nổi bật là WooThemes (nay đã không còn nữa). Thấy các đóng góp to lớn của họ cho cộng đồng, tôi cũng mong muốn mình làm được những điều tương tự. Và để làm việc đó, sức lực của 1 cá nhân rất khó. Nên tôi đã thành lập <a href=\"https://elightup.com\">eLightUp</a>, với mong muốn tạo ra những sản phẩm tốt, đóng góp cho cộng đồng và cả những đóng góp miễn phí nữa.</p>\n<p>Khi thành lập công ty, tôi đã không lường được hết những vấn đề về mặt quản lý công ty. Tôi đã phải học rất nhiều điều, từ việc quản lý con người, nguồn lực, tài chính đến những vấn đề về định hướng, chiến lược, nghiên cứu thị trường, marketing. Đối với 1 developer, đây đều là những thứ mới mẻ và thách thức. Có những khoảng thời gian tôi đã rất áp lực, vì vừa phải phát triển sản phẩm, vừa phải làm những công việc khác vốn không phải là thế mạnh của mình.</p>\n<p>Đến nay, mọi thứ đã tốt hơn, tôi đã quen dần hơn với công việc, mặc dù tôi vẫn phải code và quản lý cùng một lúc.</p>\n<p>Nhưng mà, trên tất cả, tôi thấy những gì mà mình có được bây giờ đều là sự may mắn, và đó đều là sự yêu thương, support từ cộng đồng đã dành cho tôi. Bởi thế, cho dù mọi thứ có khó khăn, thách thức như thế nào, tôi vẫn cảm thấy rất vui với những gì mình đang có, và sẽ cố gắng để làm mọi thứ tốt hơn.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Growing%20a%20WordPress%20business%20in%20Vietnam&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgrowing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgrowing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fgrowing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam%2F&title=Growing+a+WordPress+business+in+Vietnam\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/growing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/040319-min-150x150.jpg&description=Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/growing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam/\" title=\"Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/growing-a-wordpress-business-in-vietnam/\">Growing a WordPress business in Vietnam</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Apr 2019 02:00:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Anh Tran\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 7.1 Adds Feature Suggestions to Plugin Search Results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88404\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-7-1-adds-feature-suggestions-to-plugin-search-results\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10445:\"<p><a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2019/03/05/jetpack-7-1-business-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack 7.1</a> was released earlier this month with new blocks for WordAds, Business Hours, Contact Info, Slideshows, and Videos.

I see the future of these suggestions to be used by plugin authors to keep their product first in certain plugin search terms for upsells like admin notices. </p>\n<p>What do you think about this? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DontHijackWPAdmin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DontHijackWPAdmin</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/TERjrPgEt6\">pic.twitter.com/TERjrPgEt6</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Mehul Gohil (@mehul_gohil0810) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mehul_gohil0810/status/1110488258587308033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Manipulating search results, even to insert an artificial result, using a plugin that is already installed, is a major new development among plugins hosted on WordPress.org. Automattic is setting a precedent for other plugin authors that want to recommend their own add-ons or extensions when users match certain search terms. </p>\n<p>In the feature&#8217;s initial <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/10611\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proof of concept</a>, Jetpack product lead Beau Lebens explained the motivation behind adding suggestions to the search screen:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve seen that people with Jetpack installed and activated often search for Jetpack features (even by name) in the Plugins > Add New screen in wp-admin. This new module attempts to spot those searches, and provide an artificial search result that calls out that what they&#8217;re looking for is in Jetpack, which they already have, and which is already active.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Eight years since its initial release, Jetpack has grown to 45 modules. Most users are not familiar with everything the plugin offers. In fact, many users may not have even installed Jetpack themselves, as it often comes pre-installed with hosting. The suggestions may prevent users from adding alternate third-party plugins, as Jetpack&#8217;s module placement in the results subtly implies that these are inferior options to its existing modules. </p>\n<p>One of the reasons the feature has many developers rattled is because the UI fails to make it clear that this is an artificial result and not something generated by the plugin directory&#8217;s algorithm. Although it is intended to function more as a notice, for the regular user, it is virtually indistinguishable from an advertisement in its current implementation. It hasn&#8217;t been live for very long, but over time it may even make it more difficult for plugin developers to offer plugins that compete with Jetpack features.</p>\n<p>The feature suggestions in plugin search results became a hot topic on <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Post Status</a>&#8216; Slack where Automattic&#8217;s Gary Pendergast dropped in to reiterate the Jetpack team&#8217;s intentions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve been talking to some folks on Jetpack about what’s going on,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;I think the team’s end goal is pretty good, and it solves a real problem WordPress has. Too often, site owners install masses of plugins that they don’t need, which ultimately creates all sorts of security, performance, and stability issues. In this particular use case, if a site owner is looking for functionality that Jetpack already handles, then the owner should be aware of that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pendergast also said he thinks WordPress core should offer an API for any plugin to be able to do something similar.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Team Says Jetpack&#8217;s Artificial Search Results Do Not Break WordPress.org Guidelines</h3>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s easy to conjure up different ways to abuse this avenue for advertising a plugin&#8217;s existing features, WordPress.org&#8217;s plugin team is ready to deal with a potential influx of various implementations on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not really advertising anything &#8211; it&#8217;s just adding search results for pieces of a plugin that you already have and might not know about, so it&#8217;s not really against any rules,&#8221; Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;If it was misleading in some manner, then that would be different.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wood said the team discussed it but concluded that any implementation of something similar in other plugins will need to be reviewed to see if it&#8217;s doing anything misleading.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Realistically it&#8217;s always going to be a judgment call of some sort,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;For example, if a plugin was to insert search results for other plugins, then that wouldn&#8217;t be okay, because it&#8217;s misleading. But, this isn&#8217;t that case. It&#8217;s just trying to say &#8216;hey, you have a plugin already installed which does what you&#8217;re looking for,&#8217; so it&#8217;s trying to be helpful in that respect. It may not necessarily be the best way of accomplishing that goal, admittedly. But it&#8217;s pretty valid.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wood did not place a hard requirement on having the artificial result be dismissible but said anytime a developer inserts something into a screen where would not normally be, having dismiss functionality is good UX. He doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s likely that many other plugin authors will implement something similar since most are not collections of dozens of plugins and add-ons. However, this type of suggestion seems like it would also be applicable to block collection plugins that include dozens of Gutenberg blocks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It will be really difficult for users when all the essential plugin authors implement it,&#8221; Gohil said in response to comments on the screenshot he tweeted. &#8220;They are using JS to hack into plugin search using hook &#8216;admin_enqueue_scripts&#8217; and that&#8217;s not good. I&#8217;m not in favor of it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If more plugin authors begin adding suggestions, users could see several rows of artificial results before seeing any real ones, depending on which plugins they have installed. Plugin developers are already brainstorming ways to strip the feature suggestions out. It likely will not be long before plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hide-jetpack-promotions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hide Jetpack Promotions</a> removes the artificial search results to maintain results as delivered by WordPress.org. </p>\n<p>Wood said the plugin team does not intend to write any new guidelines for plugin authors creating their own implementations of feature suggestions on the search screen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The difference is always going to be one of intent,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;It&#8217;s JP&#8217;s intent here to notify the user of the existence of a feature they may not know about. That&#8217;s trying to be helpful to the user, not trying to shut out competition. It doesn&#8217;t remove search results. It doesn&#8217;t reorder them or filter them. It just adds a card about the feature you&#8217;re searching for. If you don&#8217;t have JP, then it can&#8217;t do anything. It&#8217;s not advertising for other plugins or anything like that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jetpack is also <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/blob/361a99f6ae70152b52142aa682c8a6c25b5afc04/modules/plugin-search.php#L291-L292\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tracking search terms longer than three characters</a>, and Wood confirmed that this is also within the guidelines, as long as it is disclosed to the user.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The whole tracking module doesn&#8217;t activate until after you agree to the ToS thingy, so honestly, it&#8217;s allowed,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;They track lots of things for stats and such. Realistically, so do many other plugins. As long as you ask the user first, before tracking anything, then tracking data is allowed. Opt-in is the rule.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wood said he found the search term tracking to be unnecessary since WordPress.org already collects this information through its new search system that runs on ElasticSearch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We get all the search terms on the WordPress.org servers, anyway, so both we and they kinda already have them,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;Automatticians built our newest plugin search engine, after all. It seems kind of a waste to track them using Jetpack when they literally receive all the searches to run through the search engine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jetpack’s artificial search results, although dismissible, take up the top spot, bypassing the algorithm altogether. It gives the appearance that Jetpack&#8217;s built-in feature is either a promoted listing or superior to all other options available in the directory. </p>\n<p>Although a suggested module may work more harmoniously with other Jetpack features than a third-party plugin, the modules are built to be fairly general in terms of features. They address the basic needs for the largest number of users but rarely provide more options than a standalone plugin dedicated to performing something similar. Users may very well be searching for a replacement for what Jetpack provides. The ability to easily turn off suggestions in search results with a toggle could go a long way for diplomacy. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Apr 2019 15:40:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Automattic Launches Happy Tools Product Line for Distributed Teams\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=88372\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-launches-happy-tools-product-line-for-distributed-teams\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3144:\"<p>Automattic has <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2019/04/01/happy-tools-the-future-of-work/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> Happy Schedule, the first in a new line of products called &#8220;<a href=\"https://happy.tools/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Happy Tools</a>,&#8221; created to solve problems for distributed teams. The products have grown out of internal tools that Automattic uses with its distributed team of more than 850 employees in 68 countries. </p>\n<p>Most employee scheduling tools are designed for more traditional work environments where people report to work in person in the same timezone. <a href=\"https://happy.tools/#products\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Happy Schedule</a> allows employees to set their own flexible schedules all the way down to 15-minute increments, seamlessly managing timezones for team members in one calendar. Automattic uses it to manage 24-hour global support with its 300+ Happiness Engineers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/happy-schedule.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Happy Tools is currently priced at $60/month for 12 users and then $5/user after that. </p>\n<p>&#8220;In addition to Happy Schedule, we&#8217;ll be looking to bring our customer chat tool into Happy Tools,&#8221; Happy Tools product lead Matt Wondra said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll also look at other applications Automattic has already built to help with team communication, people-management, and customer support.” </p>\n<p>The product suite complements Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-publishes-ted-talk-on-the-future-of-work-prepares-to-launch-new-distributed-blog-website\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TED talk</a> in which he evangelizes distributed work as &#8220;the future of work.&#8221; Mullenweg predicts that companies will evolve to become distributed first or will soon be replaced by ones that are.</p>\n<p>Beyond simply recognizing the benefits of employees being able to design their own work environments, there are some real challenges to becoming a distributed company. This is especially true for those that didn&#8217;t start out that way. Smaller companies have less experience navigating all the tax laws and legal processes around hiring people from different countries. These hurdles make it difficult to grow an international team and retain employees as anything more than hourly contractors.</p>\n<p>Answering some of these difficult questions gets into the meat of making distributed teams a reality. With its position as one of the few distributed companies that has successfully scaled into the hundreds, Automattic has an opportunity to open source some of its counsel, documents, and HR guides around international hiring. This would be a valuable addition to <a href=\"http://distributed.blog\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">distributed.blog</a> or the Happy Tools blog that would help more companies move beyond their initial explorations of distributed work and ultimately create a larger market for these kinds of tools.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Apr 2019 04:28:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WordPress.org blog: Minimum PHP Version update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6810\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/minimum-php-version-update/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2947:\"<p>WordPress 5.2 is targeted for release at the end of this month, and with it comes an update to the minimum required version of PHP.  WordPress will now require a minimum of PHP 5.6.20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beginning in WordPress 5.1, users running PHP versions below 5.6 have had a notification in their dashboard that includes <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/\">information to help them update PHP</a>. Since then, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">WordPress stats</a> have shown an increase in users on more recent versions of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-10.30.34-PM.png?resize=632%2C265&ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of the \" />The dashboard widget users see if running an outdated version of PHP \n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Why You Should Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your site is running on an unsupported version of PHP, the WordPress updater will not offer WordPress 5.2 to your site. If you attempt to update WordPress manually, that update will fail. To continue using the latest features of WordPress you must update to a newer version of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When updating to a new version of PHP, WordPress encourages updating to its recommended version, PHP 7.3. The PHP internals team has done a great job making its most recent version the fastest version of PHP yet. This means that updating will improve the speed of your site, both for you and your visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This performance increase also means fewer servers are needed to host websites. Updating PHP isn&#8217;t just good for your site, it also means less energy is needed for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/one-third-of-the-web/\">1-in-3 sites that use WordPress</a>, so it&#8217;s good for the planet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help updating to a new version of PHP, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/\">detailed documentation is available</a>.  This includes sample communication to send to your host for them to assist you. Many hosting companies have published information on how to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy-resources/blob/master/tutorials/hosting-specific/tutorials-en.md\">update PHP</a> that is specific for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.6 now, but soon 7+</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first increase in PHP required version for WordPress since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/\">2010</a>, but may not be the only increase in 2019. The WordPress core team will monitor the adoption of the most recent versions of PHP with an eye towards making PHP 7+ the minimum version towards the end of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/#how-to-update-your-websites-php-version-for-a-faster-more-secure-website\">Update PHP today, so you can update WordPress tomorrow!</a></p></blockquote>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 Apr 2019 14:51:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Aaron Jorbin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Sun, 05 May 2019 12:46:22 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Sun, 05 May 2019 12:30:09 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20190505124042\";}','no'),(126,'_transient_timeout_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1557103582','no'),(127,'_transient_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1557060382','no'),(128,'_transient_timeout_dash_v2_88ae138922fe95674369b1cb3d215a2b','1557103582','no'),(129,'_transient_dash_v2_88ae138922fe95674369b1cb3d215a2b','<div class=\"rss-widget\"><ul><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wordpress.org/news/2019/05/wordpress-5-2-rc2/\'>WordPress 5.2 RC2</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"rss-widget\"><ul><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-plugin-for-octobercms-now-in-beta\'>WPTavern: Gutenberg Plugin for OctoberCMS Now in Beta</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/block-options-plugin-rebrands-to-editorskit-expands-beyond-block-visibility-management\'>WPTavern: Block Options Plugin Rebrands to EditorsKit, Expands Beyond Block Visibility Management</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://poststatus.com/an-interview-with-reyes-martinez-of-frontity/\'>Post Status: An Interview with Reyes Martínez of Frontity</a></li></ul></div>','no'),(130,'theme_mods_twentyseventeen','a:1:{s:16:\"sidebars_widgets\";a:2:{s:4:\"time\";i:1557060386;s:4:\"data\";a:4:{s:19:\"wp_inactive_widgets\";a:0:{}s:9:\"sidebar-1\";a:6:{i:0;s:8:\"search-2\";i:1;s:14:\"recent-posts-2\";i:2;s:17:\"recent-comments-2\";i:3;s:10:\"archives-2\";i:4;s:12:\"categories-2\";i:5;s:6:\"meta-2\";}s:9:\"sidebar-2\";a:0:{}s:9:\"sidebar-3\";a:0:{}}}}','yes'),(131,'current_theme','Rip It With Wordpress','yes'),(132,'theme_mods_rip-it','a:1:{i:0;b:0;}','yes'),(133,'theme_switched','','yes');
